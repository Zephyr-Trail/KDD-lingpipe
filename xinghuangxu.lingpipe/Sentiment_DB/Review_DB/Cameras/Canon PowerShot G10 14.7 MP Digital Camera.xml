     <Review>Pros: Functional and fun shooting design; great enthusiast-oriented feature set; very nice photo quality

Cons: Should be a little faster shot to shot.

Bottom Line: The Canon PowerShot G10 is a solid enthusiast digital camera for those who want something compact to complement a dSLR.

Canon PowerShot G10

Panasonic&apos;s Lumix DMC-G1 offers interchangeable lenses, Nikon&apos;s Coolpix P6000 provides GPS--the feature sets on enthusiast compact cameras are all over the place these days. So, should we be disappointed that the whizziest new feature of Canon&apos;s PowerShot G10 is its almost-15-megapixel resolution? While this isn&apos;t the kind of update that will inspire envy in G9 owners or a must-have feature to experiment with, the Canon G10 holds true to the elements that have mad ... e the G series a successful shooter&apos;s camera over the years.

The G10 is physically quite similar to the G9. At 14 ounces, it&apos;s heavier by about an ounce, and it&apos;s also a bit bigger--one- to three-tenths of an inch on all sides, for dimensions of 4.3 by 1.8 by 3.1 inches. As with its predecessors, the Canon G10&apos;s metal body feels like a tank. I&apos;m beginning to wish for just a little bit more grip, though, especially since the thumb rest feels kind of slippery. 

The dial configuration ranks as the most no ...

     <Review>Pros: Very good photo quality (in good light and at low ISOs); Nice 5X zoom lens with 28 - 140 mm range; Optical image stabilization; Solid, well built body, with easy-to-access ISO and exposure compensation dials; Generally snappy performance; High resolution 3-inch LCD display; good low light visibility; Full manual controls, with plenty of scene modes too; RAW image format support; Customizable menus and buttons; Very expandable: supports an external flash, remote shutter release cable, conversion lens, and underwater case; Redeye not a problem thanks to automatic removal tool; Well implemented face detection feature -- handy face self-timer feature; Built-in neutral density filter; Fancy playback mode
Movie mode now supports up to 50 mins of continuous recording; Strong battery life ... 

Cons: Lots of noise reduction in low light -- images get noisy quickly in good light after ISO 400; No white balance bracketing or fine-tuning; Continuous shooting mode won&apos;t win any awards for speed; Lack of HD movie mode a disappointment; Design annoyances: top dials easy to bump accidentally - small shutter release/zoom controller - thumb sits right on the focus point button; Can&apos;t swap memory cards while using a tripod; Still missing the fast lens and rotating LCD of G-series cameras past

The Canon PowerShot G10 is a very capable fixed-lens camera that does just about everything right. It&apos;s fast, well built, customizable, and expandable. Unfortunately, it&apos;s biggest problems relate to image quality, specifically to noise. Canon threw the highest resolution sensor they could find into the G10 (14.7 Megapixel), and they&apos;ve had to apply a lot of noise reduction to keep noise in check. While photos look very good at low ISOs, things go downhill rapidly, especially in low light. I can recommend the PowerShot G10 to those who plan on keeping the ISO relatively low. However, if you&apos;re a high ISO or low light shooter, it&apos;s probably worth stepping up to a digital SLR.

     <Review>We reviewed the PowerShot G9, this camera&apos;s predecessor, last year. 

The Canon PowerShot G10, then, has been over a year in the pipeline and yet on the face of it, the new camera isn&apos;t so very different from the old one. 

But there are some significant differences. The one that&apos;s likely to grab the most headlines is the G10&apos;s increase in resolution, offering a 14.7 megapixel sensor where the G9 had 12 megapixels. 

Actually, though, that&apos;s probably the least important difference. Numerically, it&apos;s not very much at all and, besides, pixel densities this high bring serious noise (and noise reduction) issues as we&apos;ve seen so many times before. 

Improved lens

Instead, one of the most useful improvements in this camera is the switch from the old camera&apos;s 35-210 ... mm equivalent 6x zoom to a shorter-range 28-140mm lens. 

Yes, it&apos;s a drop from a 6x zoom to a 5x zoom, but you get a proper 28mm equivalent wide angle rather than the half-hearted 35mm equivalent of the old lens. 

There are other differences on the top of the camera. The G9 had an ISO dial at the far left, but on the G10 this has now been placed under the main mode dial to the right.

On the far left there&apos;s now a handy EV compensation dial. And it really is handy. The ability to adjust the ISO and the EV compensation so readily is like a breath of fresh air. 

RAW power? 

There are two other things worthy of special attention. One is the RAW mode... and it&apos;s not just the fact that the G10 has one, but that this camera can shoot and save RAW files as quickly as a DSLR.

     <Review>The Canon Powershot G10 has 14.7 megapixels and a wide angle, 5x optical zoom lens. It is one of the most advanced compact digital cameras you can buy. In fact I can&apos;t think of one that is more advanced. It has a full set of manual exposure modes, plus extra options for flash and focusing. 

Why Buy the Canon Powershot G10?
The Powershot G10 is very impressive. It has Digital SLR features, great picture quality and the design of the camera puts key features at your fingertips. The build quality is top drawer and the LCD screen is of the highest quality. 

Image Quality 
Outdoor 1 (Medium Zoom)
The Powershot G10 takes great photos. Focusing is excellent. This is true both in the centre of the photo and out at the edges. The brickwork on the building in the middle of thi ... s test shot is more or less pin sharp, while the name on the boat towards the left hand side of the photo is also easy to read. The colours pack a punch too, with strong blues and greens. 

Outdoor 2 (No Zoom)
Despite the fact that the Powershot G10 has a wide angle lens this is still a sharp photo. Digital cameras with wide angle lenses can create photos that lack sharpness when the lens is not zoomed in at all, but this camera outperforms the pack. 

Outdoor 3 (Maximum Zoom)
This is another example showing sharp focus. I can pick out roof tiles, plus plenty of detail at the widest points of the photo. All in all my test shots have been very encouraging so far. 

Outdoor 4 (Building)
This is the sharpest set of outdoor scenic shots I have taken in all the years I have been testing compact digital cameras. The definition in the photos is excellent and as I have mentioned above the levels of sharpness at the edges is outstanding. 

Outdoor Portrait
With this photo I would like to have seen that bit more colour in the shot. Aside from that this is another sharp photo and you should be able to take high quality general portrait photos.

     <Review>The 14.7Mp Canon PowerShot G10 is a stylish-looking compact camera.

There&apos;s something appealing about the Canon PowerShot G10&apos;s old-school rangefinder styling, and the little lights that glow orange next to the old-timey ISO and EV compensation dials.

What&apos;s more, the Canon PowerShot G10 is a solidly built point-and-shoot that packs some advanced camera features to attract digital SLR users looking for a second, smaller camera for everyday snapshots.

The Canon PowerShot G10&apos;s cool factor is no doubt a reason for its high price tag. Also, it seems to be Canon&apos;s newest attempt to win the megapixel war: the G10 is a step up from its predecessor, the 12Mp PowerShot G9. The benefits of the increased pixel count are dubious, however, as I saw in my tests.

Like the G9, the Canon PowerShot G10 offers RAW shooting options, including RAW+JPEG. It also incorporates a wider-angle lens (28mm equivalent), which worked well for my landscape shots. Unfortunately, Canon has correspondingly reduced the zoom to the telephoto equivalent of 140mm, with a 5X optical zoom as opposed to the 6X optical zoom on the G9.

That may be a letdown for some people, but take heart: Lens teleconverters are available separately, and the G9&apos;s hot shoe has been carried forward onto this model.

On the Canon PowerShot G10, Canon offers its handy My Menu feature, which stores favorite settings for recall at any time. The camera&apos;s image stabilisation mode let me make at least a few shots that we couldn&apos;t have captured otherwise, such as handheld shots of ferns in the shady New Zealand area of the botanical gardens.

The camera menus are easy to navigate after a few peeks at the manual. Common point-and-shoot features, such as face recognition, scene modes, and stitch assist for making panoramas, are on board, too.

The Canon PowerShot G10&apos;s assortment of modes includes auto, program, and shutter and aperture priority, as well as the option to go fully manual. You determine manual exposure on the LCD. A small meter appears, and below it are the camera&apos;s current exposure settings. Everything is neatly displayed, and you can easily adjust the settings using a thumbwheel on the camera back.

Things get complicated, though, with manual focus, and we quickly decided never to use that option again. On the Canon PowerShot G10&apos;s LCD, a small window within the full image appears, and you adjust focus - again using the thumbwheel - based on a bar displayed on the right edge. Having the manual-focus option is nice, but the implementation here is a bit kludgy.

Thankfully, the Canon PowerShot G10&apos;s autofocus handled most situations well enough.

The Canon PowerShot G10&apos;s battery life is superb. In our Test Centre evaluations, it fired off 456 shots on a single charge, better than nearly any point-and-shoot we&apos;ve tested.

ISO ranges from 80 to 3200, but regrettably noise and soft focus made an obvious impact on images at ISO 400 and up. Sometimes we even observed chromatic noise at ISO 100 in darker areas. And unfortunately, the Canon PowerShot G10 is often slow and inaccurate in focusing, particularly in low-light situations.

You must be patient with this camera and wait until the focus indicator says &apos;ok&apos;; otherwise the shutter will fire, and you won&apos;t get a sharp photo. In well-lit outdoor scenes, on the other hand, the Canon PowerShot G10 did just fine, and thanks to the RAW option, you can recover a lot of invisible detail.

This Canon PowerShot G10 has a good macro mode, enabling you to get 1cm from your subject. Sometimes here the camera will cast its own shadow on the subject and you&apos;ll have to back off, but some of our macro shots looked very good. The bulk of our test images, shot in a botanical garden, were punchy and vivid, but not unrealistically oversaturated. The Canon PowerShot G10 seemed to offer a pleasant boost of saturation compared with the Canon PowerShot SX10 IS, which...

     <Review>The Canon PowerShot G10 is still going to be the benchmark by which all other high-spec compacts are measured, but it&apos;s no longer the top dog. It is beaten on picture quality and portability by the smaller, lighter and slightly cheaper Panasonic LX3, and is beaten badly on value for money by most entry-level DSLRs. It&apos;s still an impressive camera and can produce excellent results, especially in Raw mode, but the price means its appeal is a little too specialised for some. Watch the video review This seems to be happening a lot lately, but it&apos;s exactly a year and a day since I reviewed the Canon PowerShot G9. Time and technology march ever onwards, so today I&apos;m taking a look at the G9&apos;s successor, unsurprisingly named the PowerShot G10. Actually it&apos;s not as predictable as all that, because ... for reasons too arcane to discuss here there was no G4 or G8, so this is actually the eighth model in Canon&apos;s flagship pro-sumer compact series. Since the launch of the G1 in 2000, the G series has been the benchmark for high-spec compacts, and the G10 raises the standard even higher. It features a powerful 14.7-megapixel 1/1.7-inch CCD sensor, a large 3.0-inch wide-view monitor with a class-leading resolution of 461k dots, and a 5x zoom image-stabilised f/2.8 - 4.5 lens with a 28mm-equivalent wide-angle setting (the G9 has a 6x zoom equivalent to 35-210mm). It has a full range of manual exposure controls, Raw mode shooting and the same DIGIC IV image processor as Canon&apos;s latest digital SLRs. Of course a specification like that doesn&apos;t come cheap, and the G10 is currently selling for around £340, although some retailers are charging over £400. This is significantly more expensive than most entry-level DSLRs. /786ec4|4ee1_9559-canong103quart.jpg The air is pretty thin up there at the top of the compact camera market, and G10 doesn&apos;t have a lot of direct competition. Its closest competitor is the fantastic Panasonic Lumix LX3 (£313), but anyone shopping for a high-spec compact will also want to consider the Nikon CoolPix P6000 (£307) and the Ricoh GR Digital II (£354). /b41ab4|903c_9559-canong10front.jpg At least the G10 looks like it should cost a lot of money. It&apos;s a large and imposing camera, measuring 109.1 x 77.7 x 45.9 mm and weighing approximately 380g fully loaded, around twice the size and weight of a typical pocket compact. It&apos;s also a few millimetres larger and around 30g heavier than the G9.

     <Review>I brought this camera after a recent trip to the snow and found my Olympus U725SW seriously lacking through the lack of a viewfinder. I didn&apos;t want to lug around an SLR, so had to squint and cross my fingers while trying to frame up the shots. When I first picked up the Canon G10 I was amazed at how heavy it felt. Not like a brick, but solid. This is one serious camera. The finish is excellent and it is well balanced in the hands. My wife picked it up and said Wow! Can I have this camera? She was particularly impressed when I plugged it into my Canon printer and produced a high quality print straight from the camera, shot in RAW. I know this is not new, but it is the first time I felt that this function is relevant. Shooting with a DSLR. the images are shot with a purpose or image in mind ... , so adjustments in Lightroom and Photoshop are almost mandatory. Shooting with the G10 is fun and spontaneous, which are the images most suited for adding to the photo album. I haven&apos;t had a chance to put the camera through its paces yet, and I am still waiting to try out some of the new functions, particularly the i-Contrast. What I do like is that this camera is just like picking up a Canon DSLR. The menu, controls and functions are almost identical. It was a very comfortable feeling to grab the camera and almost instinctively know how it all worked. The screen size is huge, and the information it displays is complete, without taking over the screen. The display showing the aperture and shutter adjustments pure genius. What I like most about this camera is that I now have a professionally built compact with a great zoom range, RAW, and heaps of Mpx that I can take almost anywhere. It fills the space between my wonderful little underwater Olympus and my superb but bulky DSLR&apos;s. Not only that, but with all of the Auto settings, it is a camera my wife and kids can use as a point and press. (The first time I haven&apos;t been grilled over a camera purchase)! Watching the green square on the screen that follows the faces around to focus is amazing, and the green beam that is emitted to pre focus with the flash is like something out of GhostBusters! I&apos;m looking forward to trying out all of the other myriad of features, such as the movie mode, custom settings and the self timer for group shots. For the life of me though, I can&apos;t ever see myself coupling up my twin flash macro system. I&apos;m pleased to say that this camera has lived up to my expectations, and apart from the lack of a CMOS sensor, I can&apos;t foresee any reason to upgrade for many years to come. This is a beautiful piece of gear and is well worth the money.

     <Review>I was looking for a serviceable replacement for my well-traveled Canon S2IS, and chose the G10 because of its mid-range zoom and the positive comments on its image quality I received from a fellow photographer. I use the camera for family, macro, travel and wildlife photography, but frequently get volunteered to take photos for music events ranging from stage concerts to parades to marching band competitions. I take an average of about 1,200 photos a month. The G10 does a great job in low light with its high ISO range, and does a better job controlling the flash intensity than past Canon cameras I have owned. It also handles the high contrast of stage lighting well. While the G10 does not have the unique zero focal length macro of the S2, S3, or S5 cameras, the 10.1 mega pixel image size ... makes up for it. You can still resolve the eye spots on a snail or catch all of the threads in a spider web. The small size (compared to a DSLR), moderate weight, and excellent battery life also make this a good travel camera. The combination of a large LCD and an optical viewfinder is a plus. The only negative I have observed is a problem handling very bright point source lighting in video mode. Stadium lights or sunset reflections over water come out fine in photos, but there are vertical white bands in video mode.

     <Review>Pros: Speed! Color-Picture Quality! Fast! Lens! Size! Weight!

Cons: Zero. Really, this is near perfection.

I&apos;ve had several Canon EOS digital cameras. I&apos;ve also owned Canon&apos;s G9 (model prior to the G10).
I am so impressed with Canon&apos;s G10. I&apos;m using it with Canon&apos;s upscale 50D and the G10 behaves more like the BMW of cameras. The colors are amazing and the shutter speed is so very fast. Expect no shutter lag if you use a quality memory card.
The fit in your hands is easy and comfortable. This is built very well. While this can be a complicated camera if you use it with manual settings, it is ever so easy when left in its AUTO mode.
This is indeed a POINT &amp; SHOOT camera but behaves like a quality SLR.
I so wish I could see thru-the-lens instead of having to use ... a aft screen though. Otherwise, perfect and worth twice its price (really).

     <Review>I recently went on holiday to Italy. The Canon G10 is a perfect camera for architectural, art and landscape photography. I also used it during a wedding and it performed excellently for portraiture and candid photography. The results of the photographs taken during this time were sharp, depth of field was excellent. The Canon G10 provides all of the necessary control from shooting raw to jpg&apos;s in auto mode as well as the many option control settings. The size is perfect for traveling. I would highly recommend this Canon. The battery life was great. The Canon zoom lens at 5x and 6.1 - 30,5 mm 1: 2.8 - 4.5 performed exceptionally well and was completely useful. The Canon G10 is a perfect camera for anyone at any skill level. A great, great camera. B&amp;H is the perfect place to buy it. Pri ... ce and customer service was fantastic.

     <Review>I use the camera for all around photography. I shoot macro for jewelry applications and I also use is to shoot houses for real estate. The Primary reason I got the G10 is because I wanted the versatility of manual ISO and Fstop adjustments. I can also adjust timing etc. Drawbacks... no open bulb timer.. which means I cannot keep the shutter open for as long as I like (fun with nightime shots), although there is a 15 second setting which is pretty much long enough for most applications. The screen is fixed and doesn&apos;t rotate around for different angles, which also means it doesn&apos;t have a fixed safe position. I used to have this on my Olympus C5060. The screen does however have a relatively big size. It only has one memory card slot, not two. I cannot, as of yet, directly download pics wi ... thout installing the software (pet peeve). It only has one other lense attachment, I would like to see a fish eye produced. It doesn&apos;t have a remote control, but the timer seems pretty easy to use. It takes a little while to process shots too. I did the research and found it was the best all around (sturdy too) camera for what I wanted, which is a lot. I haven&apos;t used nearly half the applications/settings the camera has but I love it. Not only that.. lol.. everywhere I go anyone who knows anything says O nice G10. Anyway I love the camera and know there is more room for me the grow with all the applications, but don&apos;t take my word for, do your research and good luck with whatever you buy. =) [)o] mg

     <Review>This camera appears to be the designers&apos; reaction to the limitation of ever smaller cameras. Every design constraint for small cameras seems to have been ignored in this one, and if the size is not an issue for you, the result is a really great camera.(It is an nice oppposite for my 14 meg, very compact Lumix DMC FX-150.) This camera has a huge battery that seems to last forever. It has a viewfinder style window (with diopter adjustment!) , great in sunlight when all LCD screens are at least a little hard to see. You can turn this LCD screen off. It has a built in flash and a shoe for flash as well. Big lens and 14.7 meg for clear detailed shots and a great zoom. Lots of heavy duty knobs rather than nested menus so it is easier to adjust when quick adjustment is called for. A labelled ... button for flipping pictures from vertical to horizontal! Some small negatives that do not make me regret the buy. The pop up flash or night protrait setting is not accessible through the flash menu, instead through the scenes menu, unless I simply have not figured it out. Second, I have not been able to use Photoshop to work with the RAW ouput of this camera, and there seem to be other with the same issue on the discussion groups on the web, but I am certain that Adobe will get around to fixing that - this is a very new design. Why RAW formats have to get changed all the time for each new camera is a mystery, not this camera&apos;s problem particularly. The included software is painfully slow at converting RAW to JPEG, but it does have a batch mode. On the other hand, if you get the settings right it will save both JPEG and RAW. This was not the easiest process (I got it wrong the first time and got only RAW), but possible without reading the manual - my acid test. Really a pleasure to handle this, feels good in your hands, very solid feel, well balanced. And still lighter than an SLR equipped with a similar capability lens.

     <Review>Overall this appears to be a good camera with one major shortcoming- the viewfinder - which according to Canon only covers 77% of the actual image. The viewfinder is similar to an older rangefinder type viewfinder i.e. a direct view over and generally including the lens. It is not an electronic viewfinder which would show the actual framing of your photo. Since my personal preference is to use the viewfinder as opposed to the LCD screen I find this to be a major drawback in the camera design. In order to use the Lcd screen one must hold the camera out at a distance. Using the viewfinder allows one to brace the camera squarely against your body thus reducing the potential for camera movement and allows exact framing of the shot. I imagine for casual shooters who wish to hold the camera at ... arms length, the LCD screen is appropriate, however for anyone who shots through the viewfinder this is a very significant problem. One other small but not insignificant annoyance is the lack of contrast control in the operating software. I have found Nikon software contrast control to be of immense value in controlling the the values in a picture which then can be later adjusted to optimum curves using photoshop or similar programs. Far as I can tell there is no option for same with the G10 software.

     <Review>Built like a brick (in a good way). Has RAW and all the other features I wanted in a anywhere backup camera, when either space/time or site restrictions won&apos;t let me carry the main. Everything is wonderful so far, but two features. One I want, but its unusual so I&apos;ll mention it. To take a picture, you need a gentle 1/2 push to focus, then the remainder to take the pic. This allows you to focus on one object, pan, then frame for another area. Its activatable as one of the control functions on other cameras like the Rebel. But it does take some getting used to. You can&apos;t just swoosh and hammer down the plunger for focus/picture all in one motion. If it sounds bad, I&apos;m just not explaining it well, believe me, its a great feature. The one thing I haven&apos;t mastered yet, is manual focus ... . Hard to pick one leaf out of a plant with the little scrolly wheel to focus with. Its possible you can vary the size of the focusing box, and I just haven&apos;t gotten that far yet. For the times I don&apos;t want to carry around the Rebel Xti with extended base battery pack and external flash. . . its the backup I&apos;ve been waiting for. Lightroom 2.0 doesn&apos;t support the RAW yet, but their included PC software will convert RAW to TIFF for now. (Adobe has promised the upgrade any time now for RAW.) So (as God intended) I can shoot RAW now, and improve it later when the new software comes along. Its just what I wanted. You&apos;ll enjoy it. Well placed and easily accessible controls. jkh

     <Review>Pros: Easy to Use, Good Battery Life, Good sized screen, Great Resolution, Great Zoom, Nice Features and Settings ... Cons: Not Good In Low Light I bought this camera to replace my Canon Powershot A640, which I loved. This G10 camera has loads of features above it. It&apos;s an amazing camera and rivals SLR image quality. The images have amazing color and clarity. The only thing that could replace this camera for me is a high quality DSLR. I primarily use this as a family camera for personal use and vacationing, but as a designer I find it useful to take artistic shots that are incredible. It has many features and I love the custom settings so that I don&apos;t have to reset the settings I often use (such as auto balance &amp; macro with no flash; the auto settings usually have auto flash). I&apos;m able ... to turn it on and quickly take the shot I want without having to take time to change settings for flash, focusing mode, etc. I&apos;ve used this to be able to take quick close ups of our young son with the continuous shot mode previously set so we don&apos;t ever miss a smile. AMAZING! If you are familiar with Canon menus and navigation of the buttons, this camera should be relatively easy to learn. Even being familar with Canons for several years, I&apos;ve had to adjust to a few things. The scrolling wheel on the back of the camera took a little time for me to get used to, and it&apos;s a bit difficult to use when you are trying to shoot and focus one-handed. However, when I use it for focusing I&apos;m usually closing in on a close up object, so I&apos;d have to steady the camera with both hands for those shots anyhow. The G10&apos;s grip leaves something to be desired. When wielding it with one hand I worry about slipping in my grip and ending up with a crooked shot. The shutter button is also less substantial than my older Canon cameras, but it&apos;s raised a bit more so it&apos;s easy to find when taking a quick shot. The 14.7 megapixels makes it possible to cut and crop photos to exactly what you want. The cropped photos can be enlarged and still retain great image quality. The G10 makes it possible to capture every single eyelash on my son&apos;s face. It can even pick up the individual dust specs on the table in Macro mode. The things I was looking for in my replacement camera that I had to sacrifice with the purchase of the G10 were an articulated multi-angle LCD screen and use of AA batteries. The articulated LCD comes in really handy for taking shots above a crowd or at other odd angles, but this camera sadly doesn&apos;t have it. The super bright LCD on the G10 is very clear compared to my previous camera and can be viewed at more of an angle than many other LCD screens, but it isn&apos;t able to move off the back of the camera as some Canon cameras allow. Something I had to settle for, but in the end is worth it. This G10 still has an incredibly high quality LCD screen. As far as lacking AA batteries, I have really not noticed after having the G10 for several months now. The G10&apos;s battery life is incredible. I rarely have to charge the battery, and I keep a spare battery ready so I never miss a shot. Older Lith-ion batteries weren&apos;t as good, but this is an excellent battery, able to keep up with the demands of the camera. The only cons I&apos;ve experienced with the G10 are issues with use in low light and with flash. If you are skilled with custom settings of shutter speed and ISO, you may be able to compensate for this. I find that quite often even in moderate indoor light, there is still a blur on moving objects. When using the flash indoors, the subject is often blown out and overexposed. These are things that a little adjusting in the settings can fix, but they are problems that many less-experienced people may have trouble with. Overall I&apos;m incredibly happy with this purchase and look forward to having this high quality camera for many years. Even as other cameras catch up in quality, this G10 will still be great. The G10 has become my #1 camera now. There is no contest.

     <Review>I&apos;m an new photographer and got this camera to continue learning on as a new compact that I could carry everywhere but still be able to shoot better shots than a regular point and shoot can do. This camera fits my needs so well. I&apos;m still learning how to get the most out of it, but the shots I&apos;ve already taken with it have been well worth the money. I really love the size, the color swap feature,and color accent feature. Very fun features to play with. The only thing that really bothers me is that the viewfinder is false. Kinda annoying when the sun is really out and you can&apos;t see the lcd screen. Otherwise this is a great camera for people just getting the feel for photography.</Review>

     <Review>Pros: excellent photos; rugged construction; easy to use; hot shoe

Cons: a bit more expensive than others

Canon has built a reputation in the top end point and shoot category and there has not been much competition from others such as Nikon. The power on time for the camera is reasonably fast, but not as quick as a &quot;slider&quot; style camera could be with an internal zoom lens. This model captures images on the 1/1.7 inch CCD type at a maximum of 14.7 mega pixels. In the mega pixel war, I think this has gone too far. There is no real need to have this many mega pixels in a camera with such a small image sensor. The high mega pixel count also diminishes the low light capability of the camera as can be seen in shots with a film type graininess. However, the handling of the camera is ... quite nice with physical dials to switch modes, exposure compensation and ISO speed. You can feel the ruggedness of the camera, which is as good as you can get in the point and shoot category. Having a hot shoe to add a flash is also very useful. Overall, this is a good camera, but it suffers from having too many mega pixels that reduce the image quality.

     <Review>Canon&apos;s G series have always been a hit, generation after another they find ways to improve them and the G10 continues that upward trend. It offers a fix wide angle lens and a usable optical zoom. It&apos;s higher pixels allows for stronger images when you have to use the digital zoom. The G10 also gives you very usable and powerful manual mode options. The build quality is unsurpassed, as it&apos;s built like a tank.

It&apos;s big enough so it won&apos;t be accidentally dropped but small enough so it fits in your pockets. While being so compact, it does not lack any quality. It&apos;s image sensor is bigger than that of the average point-and-shoot camera. The body is mostly metal and it looks and feels very strong.

If you&apos;re traveling and don&apos;t want to lug around your DSLR suitcase, you can easily p ... ut this in your pocket and with careful composing, you can create very professional and quality photos.

With all of this you can still take decent videos too. Although HD abilities would makes this a superb package.

     <ReviewTitle>Best point-n-shoot yet</ReviewTitle>

     <Review>Pros: Full-featured point-n-shoot with convenient controls

Cons: Certain conditions image is noisy, price

I wouldn&apos;t recommend this camera to a novice. This is a full-featured point-n-shoot, and was made for the serious amateur or professional who wants full control of their images.

As a professional, I carry the G10 with me all the time now. Even when shooting for a client, my G10 is close by. And, with a hot shoe, I can use my flash equipment with the G10. It is a great emergency stand-by camera and all around camera.

If you have been waiting for a 35-mm style range finder, this camera is it. The controls enable you to change your bracket factor (-2 to +2) via a knob on the top of the camera. You can also change the ISO via a knob. This means, no menu futzing ... for those two settings. The shutter and f-stop can be change by the thumb wheel at the back of the camera.

What is really cool is when changing the shutter and f-stop, the LCD display shows the settings much the way the view finder would on an old rangefinder.

If you are not shooting under ideal lighting conditions, like most digital cameras you will get noise. I&apos;ve read some of the other reviews where users complain about &quot;image quality&quot;. All I can say is, they must have had the camera set for a high ISO, under exposed, or used some other setting that cause excess noise.

Being able to shoot RAW is also a huge factor in my purchasing this camera. Using RAW mode in conjunction with Adobe&apos;s Lightroom is a nice advantage over other high-end digital point-n-shoots that only shoot jpegs. RAW mode allows for adjustment of settings without changing the original capture. Thus, you always preserve what your camera captured as long as the RAW file is intact.

If I were asked what single thing I would change about the G10 it would be to allow for f-16. The f-8 limits some flash and brigh-light use. Other than that, technically it has most everything else one would want.

There are a few minor things that can be frustraiting, however. First, the power button is positioned such that it is difficult to activate with glove ...

     <Review>Pros: Easy To Use; Comfortable Controls; Great Picture Quality; Bright LCD; Strong Construction; Easy Setup

I was looking for a camera that has great picture quality and is easily transportable...not bulky like the SLR&apos;s. After much research and hands-on I found the Canon G10 to be an excellent choice. The G10 is lightweight, but solid feeling, with user friendly dials and many features and modes for creative and fun shooting, including Macro. It is easy to use right out of the box on auto settings, but has many features found in more sophisticated equipment, including shooting in RAW. The picture quality is great. The G10 is small enough to fit in a purse or jacket pocket, so I am able to take it everywhere easily. The battery is long lasting, you can edit within the camera, an ... d also shoot videos. Although the LCD is large and bright I wish it folded out and rotated for more shooting options like my old camera. The zoom is not as much as I would like but the wide angle is great and the 14.7 megapixel allows me to crop in and get a good shot of a distant subject. The hot shoe is a big plus for flash control. This is a great camera. I love it!!!

     <Review>Pros: Easy to understand, Great picture quality/features

Cons: Expensive, Small zoom lens

This camera was a great purchase. It is extremely easy to just point and click, and the features are easy to understand. The picture quality is outstanding. I&apos;m sure you could get a better camera if you spend a grand, but for the price, this seems like a professional camera. This camera doesn&apos;t have a huge zoom lens, but that&apos;s not really what I was looking for in a camera. The rechargeable battery feature is nice too. Overall, this is a great camera, even if it is a bit pricey.</Review>

     <Review>I am a photographer at a large church. I need a camera that I can put into a holster and whip out when needed. Many rooms, including the sanctuary, are dimly illuminated. I have been shooting with a tripod and taking time exposures at ISO 400. Now I can shoot without a tripod, at ISO 800, with better results, and shoot 10 pictures in rapid fire in the time it used to take to make one picture. White balance is no longer an issue, the G10 corrects automatically wherever I shoot. The 28mm wide angle allows me to shoot in small rooms or get the entire sancturary in the frame. The 5x zoom and digital zoom allow telephoto shots almost anywhere. The 14 megapixels allow extreme cropping that I could never do before. This is a camera that has everything going for it, even wired remote cont ... rol that fires every time. The lens automatically caps when the camera is turned off. Also has great video mode with Quicktime format.

     <Review>Pros: High Resolution for great features

Cons: High Price at the lens provided

A wonderful camera that comes ready to start shooting. Just grab it and go on your dream trip. Keep everything in memories and print them too. This is a nice alternative to big SLR camera while giving high quality shoots. Definitely expensive but worth it for users looking to shoot on high zoom and larger landscapes from a distance or on the top of a hill. But still big to carry around in daily lives. It is considerably larger and heavier than other comparable cameras from Sony and Olympus. Definitely must have for a photographer looking to edit the photos and getting large prints. The great use in print-prduction because of its RAW IMAGES along with a true manual mode, both of which are musts for ... professional photo editing. Along with a fantastic chip processing near to real-life colors it comes with face detection and anti vibration too. In brief a wonderful camera with pro-features which can be user even by anyone.

     <Review>Pros: Versatile and powerful The G-10 Canon produces outstanding pictures. With easy to use (many)optional settings it is a superior camera. Of course having a old fashioned view finder is important for outdoor pics in bright light. The wide-angle lens is also a plus. I have made several 20&quot;X30&quot; poster prints from pictures taken at 80 ISO (using a custom setting) and there were sharp and balanced. I also value the electronic filter which I used with the above custom setting for outdoor scenic pictures. All in all the G-10 is a very powerful camera in a compact size as well.</Review>

     <Review>This is my first &apos;own&apos; camera, but have been taking many many photos with friends/ families cameras for years before. I wanted, and still do, a DSLR, but decided to go with a little less mainly because of costs. After much research this is what i came up with, for a camera with similar DSLR power, w/o expensive interchangeable lenses. I am extremely happy with this camera. It is small enough to bring along anywhere, yet large enough for that substantial, confident feel. Low light is slightly lacking, with a little more noise in higher iso than I like to see. I have only shot about 10 out of 700 pictures in auto, and I love the ease of changing settings in manual mode (with the scroll wheel and easy navigation) compared to with many compact digitals with annoying menus set up mainly for t ... he auto user. The colors and quality of the images are amazing!! I havent shot as many action shots as I would have liked to yet, but the scenic pics from fall time have been amazing. The std. wide angle on the camera is great when shooting in tight spaces. I plan to get the tele converter later down the road for outdoors. The std tele is ok, and the digital zoom clears up wonderfully, but I do find that in some instances I wish it had more tele, mainly when shooting RAW and dont have the digital zoom back up. Very solid build and construction, I am extremely protective of my gear, and I like not having to worry about every time I set it down. The strap slot should be bigger to accommodate different strap clips.

     <Review>Bought this camera for my wife and to compliment my 40D &amp; 20D DSLR&apos;s, for the times I don&apos;t want to drag camera bag, bodies and lenses around for a day. It meets my wife&apos;s needs of a simple camera, with viewfinder, but also has all the features of the DSLR&apos;s that I use in a small package. The quality of photographs is equivalent to the DSLR&apos;s that cost thousands of dollars more.

The camera is extremely simple to use in auto modes, but the menu system takes a little getting used to when using the manual modes.</Review>

     <Review>I recently bought a Canon G10 for recreational photography. I have been very happy with the camera. The G10 has complete manual capability, great portability and ease of function for point and shoot modes. I have only owned Canon digital and film cameras and am very pleased yet again. The G10 is powerful, well built, and versatile. I would recommend this camera for extreme enthusiasts and professionals. I took this camera on a recent trip to NYC and was very pleased with the results I got. There are many reviews complaining about noise levels at low light conditions/high isos. I agree that there is a good amount of noise when used in these conditions. However, I did not find it very bothersome. For the size, image quality, and price the G10 is easily the best point and shoot came ... ra on the market. I also own the lens adapter/lens. It doesn&apos;t increase focal length too much but a nice addition nonetheless.

     <Review>I bought this product a couple of weeks ago to take with me on a vacation through Europe. Since there are so few negatives, I will start with those. The camera is a bit heavy and the digital zoom is grainy - I dont recommend zooming past the optical zoom. That being said, the picture quality is amazing, it is very easy to use, and once you get the hang of the manual elements you can take professional-looking pictures in nearly any environment. It is a good size and I kept it in my purse the whole trip so I would always have it with me. Even though it is a bit heavier than I would like, I have been carrying it around NY to spontaneously take pictures. The heavier weight makes it very solid which can be a plus. It looks professional and retro and people constantly comment on how nice it lo ... oks. The large screen is great and the video quality is very good as well. My boyfriend, a semi-professional photographer, started using my camera instead of his during our trip since the pictures were of equal quality to the bigger SLR he had brought along. The battery life is exceptional and currently I have gone 10 days taking more than 600 pictures and have not charged it. Overall I would recommend this camera to anyone who wants a point-and-shoot that can be operated manually for artistic photos or in special environments.

     <Review>I use the Powershot G10 as my re-entry camera and my carry camera. I have not lugged around an SLR kit in 15 years, but I remember well the inconvenience of it all. After considering a DSLR for my re-entry to photography, I realized that a carry camera might be more versatile while in the canoe, on the bike, and just to have on my person. I have utilized the G10 for several hundred images including landscapes, flowers/macro, insects, tourist shots, and general use. I find the controls to be intelligently placed and easy to master (I have a Canon DSLR for work use). The G10 has many different settings with which to experiment, and surprisingly it does a great job in it&apos;s programmed modes. The resolution is very good. I stick with ISO 200 or lower, as others have mentioned significant ... noise above that. I do not use the viewfinder, the display is wonderful. I am very pleased with the feel and quality of the camera, and feel I got a good value for my money. The unit fits my mission well. I would like to see additional zoom capability, so I gave it 4 stars.

     <Review>I recently purchased this camera for my trip to Hawaii. I wanted something that gave me the options my dslr gives me without the weight and the bulk. And I gotta say, I really liked it! There are a few things I&apos;m not crazy about (the noise levels when you shoot anything above 400, the spot metering and the long recycle time) but over all I am very impressed. The controls are very similar to other Canon cameras and the picture quality for a point and shoot is superb. I wouldn&apos;t use it to replace my 5d and I still found myself using my 5d while on vacation just not as much. All in all, it is a very good camera for the value.</Review>

     <Review>Pros: Great LCD Screen, Quality feel, Quick power on, Very user friendly ... Cons: Memory card location Having been a life long Nikon user (and partial to their lenses for image quality) - I was in the market to upgrade from my last digital (almost 3 yrs). My previous issue with Nikon was power on time and shutter lag as well as little &quot;user&quot; control, especially in low light situations. Having researched a number of upper-end P&amp;S options, the Canon seemed to continually come up amongst the best picks. Canon is very quick and responsive when powering on as well as providing the user with full manual control. For low light levels - it also has a hot shoe for a top mounted flash. The LCD is very impressive (and has a &quot;gyro&quot; that rotates images when viewing). Quality has been highly impres ... sive.

     <Review>Pros: Good macro mode, Great image quality, Large LCD screen, Looooonnnnng battery life, RAW images ... Cons: Slow maximum aperture I own a Canon 40D DSLR with several lenses but bought the G10 because its small(er) size and lighter weight make it an easier camera for on-the-go shooting. Image quality is quite good with minimal noise, distortion and vignetting across the zoom range. The ability to save RAW image files offer much greater postprocessing control to compensate for exposure and color defects. I still use the 40D for work shots but for pleasure and recreational use, the G10 provides the ability to produce images of comparable quality in a much smaller package. Built-in Image Stabilization dramatically reduces camera shake at low shutter speeds. Battery life is simply the best I&apos; ... ve yet found. My G10 is sitting here next to me and hasn&apos;t been recharged since late June. Despite shooting over 300 images at a wedding last weekend, it still shows nearly a full charge. The zoom range in the G10 skews more towards the wide angle end than in the G9 but sacrifices considerable magnification in the telephoto end. I&apos;d prefer to see Canon develop future models with a wider zoom range lens instead of larger image file sizes. I&apos;d also like to see a wider ISO range and faster maximum apertures to better function in low or marginal lighting conditions. Also missing in the G10 was the G9s slick interval shooting option, enabling images to be shot automatically at preset intervals. While the G10s ergonomics and operation are well thought out and reasonably intuitive, it&apos;s worth emphasizing that this is a complicated camera that&apos;s probably not appropriate for technophobes or casual users. But in the hands of a willing student, it&apos;s probably the best Point &amp; Shoot camera available today.

     <Review>This is a high quality, well built camera capable of taking excellent quality photographs. I have been using it for about 2 months now and have taken it to Japan and Australia. Prints from a 3800 on VFA are simply stunning. I apply Ken Stones recommendations to begin with and they work very well, although I don&apos;t use the Vivid color mode. The top dial exposure compensation is a great convenience. I haven&apos;t had this much fun using a camera in years. There are only 3 draw backs that I have been able to find: Unless you shoot in RAW the only color space for jpegs is SRGB-it would be better to have ADOBE RGB as the color space; There is No Bulb setting-even with the wired remote; I purchased the 270 ex external flash-unless I&apos;m doing something wrong, after you set your flash compensation, if ... you review your shots (who doesn&apos;t?) the compensation doesn&apos;t stick when you go back into shooting mode, it would be better if you didn&apos;t have to reset it after each review. (if I&apos;m missing a setting please let me know) The LCD is really good-your pictures will never look as good as the LCD.

     <Review>I direct a small group of video producers and photographers at a major public university. We have a large arsenal of Nikon D2X and D2H cameras and lenses for normal use, but I wanted something small that could be easily carried. The Canon G10 makes beautiful images. The combination of automatic modes along with dedicated controls for ISO and exposure compensation provide great control. The addition of an easy to operate manual mode makes this a powerful tool. I bought one for each of my staff to carry with them at all times.</Review>

     <Review>I am a landscape photographer and use the G10 primarily as a back up to my 5D. It is also used as a travel camera to take meaningful and unique photos rather than the standard tourist fare. It&apos;s manual controls and RAW capability facilitate that. However, if you need to hand it to someone to take the quick picture of me with the big fish or the Elvis look-alike, just set it on Auto and it performs marvelously. Autofocus and shutter delay is tolerable, but slow like all point-and-shoots. You don&apos;t want to try to shoot breaching whales or hummingbirds, but it is fine for most shots. The color balance and rendition is excellent! Especially in RAW, and quite brilliant in JPEG. It is sturdily built and if you are familiar with Canon menus on their other DSLR&apos;s or point-and-shoots, you&apos;ll ... be comfortable with this camera. A few of the features like face recognition and i-Contrast are tricky, but easy to learn with a little practice. The battery performance is excellent. If you have a backup and charger, you set for weeks of travel without a problem. As reported elsewhere, low light performance is medium and ISO above 400 gets pretty grainy. Noise reduction programs can do wonders up to 400 and make tolerable up to 800. Higher is....well, pretty messy

Very full-featured and powerful camera in a tiny package. I got this as a backup to my DSLR, but after seeing the image quality and easy portability, it may become my primary shooter. Excellent image quality you&apos;d expect from a Canon, very solid build-quality, nice controls. I especially love the macro focus and movie modes.</Review>

     <Review>Pros: Nice Features and Settings; Great Resolution; Great Zoom; Easy to Use; Good sized screen; Good Battery Life; Excellent in Low Light

Bought this to photograph structural features of buildings for insurance work. It is great, it has all the manual controls necessary to get great shots in low light. I picked this camera, because it seems like it has enough extra manual features to be close to a DSLR, however it is about 1/2 the size and weight. Also thought this would be a great first step towards a DSLR if I thought I needed one down the road. Right now this will be perfect for my needs. 

The first battery charge lasted about 3 weeks, with me using it about 1/2 hr/day, still on second battery charge! 

AND, Adorama offers a great package!</Review>

     <Review>As easy to use as you want and suitable for all skill/interest levels. Enough practical features for a semi-pro. Only slight disappointment is the image quality - could have been better, especially as nearly 15MP. Amazing that no memory card whatsoever included! Screen is brilliantly big - but proud of body so will easily scratch/damage if camera laid down on back. Best price I could find anywhere at the time.</Review>

     <Review>I had really high hopes for this camera. The first one I received had a dead pixel in the rear LCD display. After ten-plus years of purchasing digicams, this was the first time I&apos;ve ever encountered a flaw like that. Kudos to B&amp;H for a quick and seamless return process. Once I received the replacement, I ran approx. 150 test shots through it under various lighting conditions. Low light performance wasn&apos;t as bad as I&apos;d heard, although higher ISO certainly produced more noise than lower ISO&apos;s. The controls were logically placed and I loved the knobs on the top. Once familiar with the controls, you can very quickly make adjustments and tweaks to shooting modes and exposure. The build is top notch. This camera feels very sturdy and fits my hand more comfortably than any other PS. I ... have an older 2MP Powershot A series and this is actually smaller than that one. Canon is really packing a ton of features into smaller bodies. My primary issue with this camera is shooting moving subjects. This camera takes stunning photos if your subject is perfectly still in adequate lighting, however, if the subject is moving, you might have some issues. several photos of my kids and my dog had motion blur, even at close range with flash. Autofocus also wasn&apos;t as quick as I would have liked. I realize this can be corrected with manual adjustment, and I&apos;ve played with settings to produce gorgeous portraits of my kids. However, if I&apos;m running around an amusement park trying to snap pics of constantly moving subjects, I don&apos;t have time to keep making manual adjustments. Photos also tend to sometimes show unacceptable noise when enlarged to the highest resolution. Raw shooting gave great results and the included Canon software gives you good editing control over raw images.

     <Review>Pros: Good Image Quality, Good Image Stabilization, Great Zoom, Large Clear LCD ... Cons: Cost, Heavy vs other ps, Lag / Shutter Delay, No HD Video This is a great camera for those who want more options than just standard point and shoot. I am learning more about photography and adjusting camera settings; the G10 provides a great platform to do that without spending a lot of money on a SLR. I have some friends who are formal/pro photographers who use this camera as a &quot;grab and go&quot; they can always carry with them, and/or take to places where it is not practical to lug around all of their SLR equipment. It also has the capacity to shoot in RAW format, which is a great feature. One of the things I didn&apos;t like about this camera is the time between shots. Compared to other point and shoots, it ... is slow, unless you are in one of the more quick shooting modes. It usually is not a big issue, but it can be annoying at times. The G10 is also heavier and bulkier than many of the point and shoots out there. It will not fit in a pant or small shirt pocket, but it is small enough to carry around in your purse or bag. The sturdiness of the build does have it&apos;s advantages; I have dropped mine more than a few times, and it is still working great! It is disappointing that Canon still has not put HD video on their cameras. If you are planning on shooting a lot of video, I would look elsewhere. Added Note: I have since upgraded to the G11(better in low light), but have given my G10 to a friend. She absolutely loves the quality of the photos it takes, even in auto mode! If you have a G9 and are looking to upgrade, I might say that you would do better to upgrade to the G11 vs. G10. However, for most casual photographers, the differences between the G11 and G10 are not significant enough to necessitate purchasing the newer version.

     <Review>Pros: Can add lenses, Easy To Use, Excellent image quality, Large Clear LCD, Nice Body Color, Quick charge battery ... Cons: Not an SLR I owned the G7 and upgraded to the G10 (passed the G7 into open arms of my daughter!). I must say that I LOVE my camera. This camera has great features, huge quality and fits in most decent sized purses/bags; no not in your jeans/shirt pocket. It is not a SLR which seem to be all the rage but I one of the reasons that I love this camera is that it has HUGE power without the HUGE size. I have GREAT photos from this camera. Reading the entire user manual will increase the appreciation of the features packed in this camera. It&apos;s more than a just a point and click!!! After buying the G7 in 2007 and now the G10, I continue to be amazed with the image quality! T ... he ability to use the more advanced features/settings or go with all auto is great; sometimes I want to be more creative and other times I just want snapshots of friends and family. I highly recommend this camera and haven&apos;t had any problems with it at all. Use iMac to process images.

     <Review>Pros: Flash is adjustable; Great Picture Quality; Convenient to Carry; Easy To Use; DSLR-like Controls; Strong Construction; Comfortable Controls; Easy Setup; Bright LCD

Cons: Low light noisy; Flash needed in low light

Bought this as a backup for my 5D. Great camera to carry around and convenient to take on vacation. Has many same/similar controls and features as Canon DSLR&apos;s. LCD is bright, has high resolution, and is easy to read even in daylight. Picture quality, resolution, color, contrast in daylight and well-lit night situations is superb. Low-light no-flash shots are no match for a good DSLR, but adjustable flash exposure works well at night. Flexible controls and settings let anyone from beginners to pros take great photos. Would highly recommend this to any photo ent ... husiast, serious amateur, or pro.

     <Review>My Use: Backup to EOD 40D, as well as a larger pocket camera to bring with me on trips, to meetings. I&apos;m a designer and photographer, and take loads of pictures for a variety of needs. Overall review: Camera performed amazing so far. Love quick change on all manual settings (ISO, shutter speed, apeture). Quick change white balance, etc. RAW format and high quality images. Problems: Photos at higher ISO&apos;s and in low light conditions have significant noise when compared to a digital SLR, but performs competitively in ideal conditions or with a flash. The big setback is that you have to use canon&apos;s software to extract and read the RAW file and then send it to Photoshop in either TIFF or PSD format. I found a way around this by updating Lightroom to the newest version, which include ... s the drivers to read the G10&apos;s RAW format. Didn&apos;t understand why Lightroom made the updated but not Photoshop, but guess that&apos;s Adobe&apos;s logic. I&apos;m sure down the road this will be fixed. I love this camera so far, and really happy with it. Recommended.

     <Review>Professionally I use a Canon 5D with pro lenses and such, but this camera makes me feel spoiled. It&apos;s truly the most intelligent point and shoot out there. The controls make it easy to adjust ISO and compensation for the perfect shot. The large LCD screen gives you a live preview of the exposure based on your settings. And has a handy live histogram too. The face detection is amazing. I held the camera up and panned it around the room at Christmas time and it picked up any and every face immediately as it came into the frame. The macro capabilities are really impressive too! It opens up photo ops that you never considered with another point and shoot. It&apos;s a 28-140mm equivalent focal length is more width than any point and shoot I&apos;ve ever had. A nice touch when you run out of room t ... o back up when you&apos;re taking a group shot. And it shoots RAW! It&apos;s maybe more than pocket-sized, that might be the one downfall I see at this point, but the pay off is well worth it.

     <Review>Pros: Comfortable Controls; Great Picture Quality; Easy To Use; Bright LCD; Strong Construction

I&apos;ve read some reviews that dont favor the G10. I dont agree. I have used DSLRs exclusively the past few years and I got this camera as a light weight alternative for hiking and rock climbing. Its a great camera and I am very happy with it. The image quality is simply the best of any compact I&apos;ve tested. I dont need it to do ISO 800+ and one handed operation is a must for my application. The image stabilization is superb, giving me a few more stops at ISO 80, and also works well to make movies very smooth. The controls are very easy to use and very well thought out. I&apos;d like an even wider lens but at 28mm it is working well so far. HD video would also be nice.</Review>

     <Review>Only a few months prior, I bought the G9 for my wife as a camera that she could enjoy taking snapshots with while I was working on our vacations. It was such a sweet, sophisticated camera that I kept hogging it. I&apos;d never before used such a satisfying point-and-shoot camera. When the G10 came out, I quickly sneaked a purchase. The wide-angle lens is a nice addition. (It would&apos;ve been nice if they&apos;d bumped the HD video feature from 15 fps rather than eliminating it altogether, but that&apos;s not what I bought the camera for.) Shooting with RAW, I find the image quality and the portability to be an astonishing combination. As a 35-year veteran of film &amp; dslr cameras, I&apos;d never had much experience with live view LCD framing. Now I see the virtues (and am looking forward to purchasing ... the 5D Mk II when it becomes available). I think that this camera is changing my shooting style, because it is so ready to bring and to use anywhere and everywhere -- without fear that I&apos;m going to get a great shot with an inferior image. And it isn&apos;t simply a point-and-shoot; this camera has a deep well of creative options to use at-will. As a long-time serious &amp;/or professional photographer, I&apos;m very impressed. (Assignment to self: Use only the G10 for a year.)

     <Review>I have 2 old Canon Point and Shoot cameras - an ancient 2MP Elph and a 5MP G5 - both still work perfectly after all these years so you know I like and trust the brand. When I went to the big Javits photo show, I had a chance to handle the new G10 and while I need another camera like I need $4 a gallon gas, I fell in love and just had to have one. I have been using mine for a couple of weeks and can&apos;t believe how good it is. While it has an optical view finder, I have become addicted to the huge, bright screen for all shooting. It&apos;s much easier on my myopic eyes, even in bright sun. The zoom range is pretty good but the real attraction for me is the 28mm wide angle end of the range. For groups and pictures in tight spaces (I go a lot of grip and grin shots for magazines) it&apos;s a life saver ... . I plan to use it like I used to use my Leicas - a pro-level always with me camera. The battery life is good. The power of the flash is good too - I like the feature that lets you pick the shutter speed so you can set the speed slow enough to pick up ambient background light. That&apos;s right - no more black backgrounds with flash! The old P&amp;S bugaboo - shutter lag - has been tamed with the G10. It&apos;s not as perfect as my M4, but it&apos;s pretty darn close. Finally, image quality - JPEG or Raw - is very good. Color is good too - I think the optics are first rate. I plan to use it as a backup for my DSLRs for magazine and travel photography. I recommend the G10 to anyone who wants a good camera - the images are pro quality. The build quality is excellent and based on decades of experience with Canon equipment (4 EOS cameras, 2 P&amp;S, 1 video and a D40) I am confident that it represents good value.

     <Review>If you&apos;re on the fence no need to be, this camera has some of the best image quality for any P&amp;S under $500 on the market. If you need a wider angle or faster lens or do a lot of low-light photog then I would recommend the Panasonic LX-3. The reason to go for the G10 is better zoom range, higher pixels which do help for prints, and better software. The size of this camera is bigger than most P&amp;S cameras but it is not bad. It&apos;s more of belt pouch-sized camera than pocket-sized. Those of us with large hands prefer the G10. Don&apos;t plan on using ISO higher than 400 unless in a pinch or willing to clean it up in post-processing. I use my Canon Speedlites with this camera to get the most out of this camera in the low ISO range. G10 is simply the best good light P&amp;S on the mark ... et, my favorite street camera in good or average day light. For low light conditions you&apos;ll still need to rely on a dSLR. Pricey but I&apos;m happy with the price-to-performance thus far.

     <Review>The Canon Powershot G10 is an awesome camera. It is a step up from a regular point and shoot but not quite at the DSLR level. Small enough to be portable yet very well built. The features and capabilities are tremendous. I love it because I use it as a backup camera to my DSLR and when I need to capture an unexpected great shot. This book by Magic Lantern Guides is well done. Lots of information, easy to read and nice visuals. It is so much better than the G10 manual.</Review>

     <Review>This is my backup camera and very useful in terms of watching a concert that a professional camera is not allowed. But they should not include the JPEG file when you shot it in a RAW mode because this will eat your memory stick a lot. And also the color of the image in LCD screen is not the same when you download it into your computer??? you need to edit it into Digital Photo Professional Software, which is included in the package. Other than that??? it???s almost perfect!</Review>

     <Review>Pros: Rugged; Good sized screen

Cons: Low-Quality Pictures; Not Good In Low Light

I really wanted to like this camera. I have been searching for a decent small digital camera, so I don&apos;t have to lug my D700 everywhere I go. I always carry a camera and thought this might be perfect for times I don&apos;t expect to make photos. Well, while it appears very well made, has a very nice monitor, I just couldn&apos;t live with only f8 in manual mode (not sure about A or P mode), or the high Noise above ISO 400. Also, I&apos;m a long time Nikon user and the controls just aren&apos;t up to the logic of Nikon. Take the manual mode, it has a nice dedicated knob to switch between modes but manual mode default is to adjust the shutter speed. To adjust the f stop took a lot of button-guessing, head scrat ... ching. Too many controls need the manual to operate. Maybe to Canon people it all makes sense.Any way, it went back, and my search for a digital Contax T2, or Nikon 28/35ti continues.

     <ReviewTitle>Last Years New G10</ReviewTitle>

     <Review>Pros: Fast Shutter Speed; Easy to Use; Great Zoom; Great Resolution; Large Clear LCD; Good Battery Life

I wanted a new camera this year and decided to buy last years G10 instead. When my passion to rediscover shooting manually again peaked, I decided to cash my birthday check before something around the house broke)and opted for a refurbished G10. I just wish I&apos;d bought this camera sooner.
Out of the box, the big, vivid 3&quot; display was a welcome relief from not having to wear my readers. The battery life is incredible (around 400 plus shots). My old canon would eat double A&apos;s like candy. Additionally, the image stabilization is an big improvement, especially with the face detection. For my work I shoot interiors and use a auxillary light source, so shooting in low light conditions ... isn&apos;t a problem.
Outside it no problem at all.
Overall, the look and feel of the G10 reminds me of my old nikon and I love making choices with the top mounted mode dial. I love using and handling the G10 and look forward to discovering the possibilities that lie ahead.

     <Review>This is my second G10 -- quickly replaced it after original was stolen (along with my Nikon DSLR) by a thug in Denver. Powerful camera in a compact package. Durable, solid build. I&apos;ve taken the G10 with me on trips to the Dominican Republic, Iraq, and Korea, and used it as a backup at Yellowstone and Grand Teton. It&apos;s bigger than many point and shoots, and doesn&apos;t easily fit into a shirt pocket. But, it has great battery life, excellent image quality, OK (not great) low light performance, and is a perfect all-around travel camera.</Review>

     <Review>Pros: Zoom Range; Strong Construction; Lots of manual control; Great Picture Quality; size

Cons: Poor Operation in Low Light

I like what it offers for the money in picture quality. It reasonably fast for general photography.

The IS and zoom range are good for most uses.

The controls are bit cramped and confusing after being used to SLR cameras. But one gets used to them. Low light performance isn&apos;t anything to cheer for, but a lot can be saved with software noice removal.

There is nice amount of control over exposure so it makes worthy camera even for pros who want something that fits in to the pocket.</Review>

     <Review>This is a definitely a great compact digital, and all of the reviews I&apos;ve read suggest it is as an alternative to a budget DSLR, but if you&apos;re looking for the image quality of a DSLR, this is not the right product for you. This camera is for the pro, or semipro photographer that doesn&apos;t want to carry around his heavy DSLR around all of the time. It gives you full manual control, which is my favourite feature, but struggles with colour rendition at anything above ISO 400. I would have like to have seen HD video capabilities. There are large gaps in the front of the lens that allow sand, and other dirt to get into the lens very easily.</Review>

     <Review>I was a serious view camera amateur. Now, as a retired grandfather, I&apos;m tired of hauling all that stuff around. With the G-10, I tinker and use all of the automatic modes as well as the manual mode. However, when I am rushed, I use AUTO and am rarely dissapointed. It&apos;s nice not to have to search around a menu for ISO settings; there&apos;s a handy knob on top. And for what it&apos;s worth, I shot over 400 photos with one charged battery on a recent trip to India. It&apos;s also nice to be able to record both a jpg and RAW at the same time. I don&apos;t always have time to mess with my digital photo software. The picture quality exceeds my expectations, the view screen is large and bright, even the movie clips are suitable for SD playback with animated slide show films. The rechargable battery lasts a ... long time, but find-em-anywhere AA&apos;s they&apos;re not. I bought a stand-by just in case. Once at a zoo in Singapore the low battery indication occurred. Not having a spare, I was worried. But as it turns out the battery lasted for the remaining 30 shots I took and didn&apos;t die.

     <Review>I use the G10 when I don&apos;t want to carry around my 30D with battery grip and a bag full of lenses. It produces great quality pics when you don&apos;t want to be too conspicuous with a D-SLR but still need pro-level features. The only feature missing is a bulb shutter setting. Also, a nice quality wrist strap (along with the neck strap) would be nice. Absolutely a great camera and I have recommened it to friends who have since purchased the G10 (from B&amp;H I might add). Would have given it 5 stars, but the shutter lag time could be shorter. Built like a tank. Controls are conveniently located and easy to use. Great feel in your hands.</Review>

     <Review>Purchased this camera about a month ago and I&apos;ve been attached to it since. I take it everywhere. Picture quality is awesome for the price. Still figuring out some of the more advanced settings, but I love the AUTO point and shoot. The pictures are so crisp and clear. I recommend this to anyone looking for a great camera to capture special moments and to take fun pics (color swap and accent color option is fun to play with).</Review>

     <Review>Pros: Strong Construction; Bright LCD; Easy To Use; Great Picture Quality; Easy to Keep Clean; Comfortable Controls; Easy Setup

Cons: Long Lag Time

I received this camera for my birthday (from the best sister in the world - if you&apos;re reading this, thank you again). I&apos;ve only been using it for about 2 weeks but I&apos;m already in love. I travel as much as possible and photograph everything from nature to people and landscapes to still life. I have high hopes for the G10. This is a serious upgrade from my 5 year old point and shoot. The image quality is superb, the wide angle lens is great for artistic/landscape shots, the image stabilization function works well, and the camera feels sturdy (although I wish it was weather-proof like my previous Olympus Stylus series point and shoot ... ). The camera has an optical viewer which is handy for desperate times of low battery and an optical zoom range of 5x! The only real downsides are that the camera is a bit bulky, the lag time between flash shots are a bit long and the zoom knob could also be bigger.Indoor shots without flash are good as long as you minimize shake. I&apos;ve explored a few of the special scene/filters and the color accent function is interesting. Another plus is that Canon manufactures an attachable tele converter lens to increase the G10&apos;s zoom range by 1.4x. The camera is easy to use/set up and the functions are intuitive (for an intermediate digital photographer) - I haven&apos;t even cracked open the manual yet. Overall, I highly recommend this camera if you&apos;re looking for something better than a simple point and shoot but not as advanced as a dSLR.

     <Review>Pros: excellent photos; easy to use

I love my Canon Powershot! The picture quality is amazing, even when compared to more expensive point and shoot cameras that are available. Zoom quality is great, but I never feel as though I need to zoom because once I get onto my photo website, I can crop the pictures and the quality is upheld. The camera has a way to connect a tripod to it, as well as a timer. This camera can be used in many different ways, as it also has video capabilities. Also, the Canon Powershot is easy to use. The different modes are simple to use and self-explanatory. The Canon Powershot was recommended to me and when I first used the camera, I was impressed. I couldn&apos;t put it down and I couldn&apos;t stop playing with it, finding out new things about the camera. The Canon Po ... wershoot was definitely one of the best purchases I&apos;ve ever made. It is definitely the best camera I have ever owned. I hope to upgrade when and upgrade is available, so I can stay on top of things!

     <Review>This camera replaced my G9. (I own the D3 for my main shooting). I always have it with me in my center console of my car, though I need to remove it during the hot, summer months for fear of damaging it. The controls are the easiest and by far the best there are on any P&amp;S. Immediate +- exposure compensation without fishing through a myriad of menus. Raw is a must for me as that&apos;s all I shoot. One of the few P&amp;S that offer it, and the pics are phenomenal. I&apos;ve done some rudimentary testing between it and my former 1DMKIII. I shot some scenery, some close ups of leaves on trees with blue sky backgrounds. While I didn&apos;t print them, I was hardpressed to tell the difference, and I don&apos;t believe anyone else could tell either. And I was using the Canon 24-70 L on the MKIII, a fi ... ne lens. Overall, I&apos;d highly recommend this camera. The size doesn&apos;t bother me at all. I find it perfectly fitted to my hand, unlike the G9 which I had to buy an aftermarket grip for.

     <Review>Pros: Easy To Use; Great Picture Quality; Strong Construction; Bright LCD; Comfortable Controls

Cons: Can&apos;t find any faults yet

I use the product to document my travels and photograph friends. I like the way it feels in my hands and its weight and its very bright LCD screen and that I can use an eye level viewfinder as well.
Battery life seems quite good as well. Also, this is the first still camera that I have owned which allows me to zoom in video mode.</Review>

     <Review>Pros: screan size, endless features, the video feature is great!

Cons: nothing so far.

i love this camera! i read up a lot before purchasing a camera. i couldnt make up my mind on a nikon or a canon. im glad i made the choice i did. i have heard a lot of complaints about the nikons picture qualities. This camera is unbelievable. im not a professional photographer, i just needed something that took clear pictures, and i could carry around easily. this camera is perfect size. i feel like i need a full education on how to learn on the features, but the basic camera features are simply to pick up on. one thing i love about this camera is how close you can get to an object( when in the right setting) and it is crystal clear. i took a close up on a flower and couldnt believe the de ... tail it took in the stem. i could see the little pollen on the stem. highly recommend this camera! cant put it down!

     <Review>great ergonomics, all features in the palm of your hand. awsome solution for slr photogs as a secondary portable camera. Video could have been a bit better though, no HD. Battery is somewhat weak comparing to other Canon cameras, but still gives you enough shots. Accepts all current Canon external flashes. has RAW capability.</Review>

     <Review>I use this camera for shots of my family as well work(real estate). Having used a G5 for the last 5 years this camera really shows the advances Canon has made in it&apos;s powershot line. Focusing system is great, dials to control ISO and exposure compensation are super convenient. I bought this primarily for the wide focal length (28mm equivalent) without having to carry a bulky and heavy wide angle converter. Feels good in your hand albiet a bit small for my paws. Nice solid metal construction and way more compact than a G5, about half the size. Is a little on the heavy side though due to metal construction and lots of glass. Well worth the price!</Review>

     <Review>Pros: excellent photos

Cons: a bit more expensive than others

The Canon G10 is marketed as the best point and shoot camera.  I have found this to be very true.  It blows all my other dinky cameras out of the water.  I get beautiful pictures with very little effort.  There is also a bit of control over aperature and shutter speeds, etc.  The camera is very small and easy to take with you when you do not want to lug around your huge digital slr on a trip or through crowds when a long lens may get in the way.

I have had one issue with the shutter, that has seemed to scratch the lens in 2 perfect vertical lines.  I called customer service and they wanted me to mail in the camera to have it examined to see if it was canon&apos;s error, but I never did.

The last issue I ha ... ve with the camera is that I think it is priced too high.  I could have gotten a much more advanced dslr for a few hundred more, but then I would lose out on the compactness of the G10.  I would recommend this camera to any novice or professional photographer that is looking for a great point and shoot.

     <Review>My preference is SLR, but I can&apos;t tote that thing everywhere. The G10 is my take-anywhere camera. The most important thing to my workflow is shooting RAW (which the G10 can do). Also, I wanted a point-and-shoot that didn&apos;t have the manual features buried in the menus. This camera has ISO, exposure comp, shutter and aperture easily accessible! Also, I&apos;d fallen in love with the wheel on the back of the 20D???I was thrilled to see that this was picked up with the G series. My Canon Speedlight 580EX also works with this unit (although it looks ridiculous on top of this small camera). The only problem with this camera (and every point-and-shoot) is noise. Although you have your massive 14 megapixel images, when you zoom in there is often noise in the shadows and occasionally the mid-tones (i ... n lower lighting). That being said, I think it&apos;s much better with noise than the competition and I can usually take care of the noise in post with Adobe Photoshop Lightroom.

     <Review>I bought this to augment my DSLR when I don&apos;t want to carry the volume/weight of a full setup. It has proven to be a very powerful SLR replacement tool. Difficult to use some of the more advanced features and it does not feel nearly as at home in your hands as an SLR but I love the RAW capabilities.</Review>

     <Review>You don&apos;t need the manual to operate this camera. Can you believe it? It is a bit heavier and larger than those smaller pocket cameras, but you get a lot more features and better quality images than those little guys. It is a great compromise considering the great big SLRs especially when you are going on a vacation. Sometimes a great big expensive camera means steal me. At least you can put this G10 away in your purse or bag. The screen image is particularly large and it still has the eye view in case of sun glare, which smaller cameras can&apos;t have. Only downside is the plainness of the body and the elementary look of the buttons. The camera looks like it came from the 1950&apos;s. This maybe on purpose, but it looks very cheap. That maybe good for deterring the thief.</Review>

     <Review>I take this camera skiing with me as well as most other places I go. It is so easy to pack in my pocket and does a wonderful job exposing my shots. I love the the 3 viewing screen. I have owned the G10 for 6 months and have left my Canon XTI behind with all the xtra lenses ever since. The G10 has as many controls as the XTI - very easy to use!</Review>

The difference in picture quality between the G10 and the smaller point and shoot cameras it night and day. Flash is good for a small camera and the redeye does not seem to be a problem. I sold my Rebel XTi shortly after purchasing this camera as it did everything I needed it to do. Cons: Flash is a little slow for a recharge. Lag time is acceptable but a little slow</Review>

     <Review>Great camera with lots of functions??? The camera has 3 different types of manual setting. You can do Priority Aperture, Priority shutter speed as well as full manual. On top of all the different manuals setting, you are do Manual focus. Great picture quality???! Two things that I think the camera can be improved are, the Manual focus feature seems too noisy on the lcd screen, the control can also be improved. The next thing is the camera is not easy to grab on to.</Review>

     <Review>Pros: Build Quality, Camera RAW, Control, Low ISO performance, Size ... Cons: Added megapixels, Changed kit from G9, Cost, Noise above ISO 200 Having gone through two G9&apos;s, (one stolen, its replacement, bought used, dying while on a photo vacation in Sedona) I bought the G10 without hesitation. I primarily shoot landscape at low ISO, with the camera on a tripod, and this is a brilliant bit of gear for that function. Low ISO RAW shots are on a par with heavier (and expensive) DSLRs, and the small form factor works very well for use on my motorized panorama head (Gigapan). Also the G10 improves on the G9 for HDR photos by allowing a full two stop brackets. Wouldn&apos;t have paid for the upgrade if my G9 hadn&apos;t died, as the jump from 12 megapixels to 14.5 doesn&apos;t give all that significant of an i ... mage improvement and fills cards faster in RAW format. Also my expectation that all my spare batteries and underwater casing and other G9 kit would work proved, unfortunately, false. But that said, this is still a fine prosumer compromise between a less flexible point and shoot and a DSLR. And I&apos;m not tempted to get into buying a range of lenses. The build quality is very solid, consistent with the high end pro cameras, and it will be interesting to see if the death of the G9 was a fluke. I&apos;m hoping that&apos;s the case. As for whether I would recommend to a friend, that would be purpose driven. If they need the prosumer pluses, then totally yes, but as a simple point and shoot, I would steer folks to a cheaper option.

     <Review>The G10 would be better without so many functions requiring the LED screen which is almost impossible to see in bright sunlight. It would do far better with more analogue dial-up functions and fewer things on the over-cluttered LED screen. The way it is, it takes far too long to set up a single shot. The ring around the set button is small for my fingers. I suppose a small machine will have to have small buttons, so why complain; bigger buttons would only mean a bigger and heavier camera. Compromise!</Review>

     <Review>I have been shooting Wedding photography and low-light music events for a number of years and have been utilizing the Canon 5D with great success. For my needs as a backup and for size considerations I purchased the G-10 - in spite of negative remarks regarding high ISO and low image quality. My belief is that the shooter in the digital world must also be able to pull out the stops in post-production with whatever software is used. After using the G-10 in low-light music concert situations and in general use I find that the camera excels. The low-light issues I read about did not present problems and the image results were nothing less than spectacular. The features, including the video capabilities make this camera a valuable asset to my photo work. It&apos;s ease of use and the pro features ... make it a reasonably priced back up camera - that I have used as a primary piece of equipment! Now, on to the 5D Mark II . . .

     <ReviewTitle>A fabulous camera but 2 disappointments</ReviewTitle>

     <Review>Pros: Great Picture Quality; Easy Setup; Comfortable Controls; Bright LCD; Strong Construction

Most reviews here are favourable and I wholeheartedly agree. My two disappointments are the optical viewfinder which is tiny, inaccurate, and consequently next to useless. I don’t always want to take pictures at arm’s length, even though the rear screen is first-class. Sometimes I want to shoot Leica style using the optical viewfinder. If you’re like me then, the G10, just like the preceding G7 and G9, in this area will disappoint. 

Secondly, only Photoshop CS4 will open the G10s RAW files. Having paid a small fortune for CS3 – a wonderful piece of software what does all and more than I want it to – I REALLY don’t want to shell out again for the update. At the time of writing this ... in February 2009, the word on the web is that Adobe have no plans to release a plug-in for CS3 to recognise my lovely G10 RAW files. So be warned – budget as well to further line Adobe’s pockets.

One further problem to overcome...this camera does not easily lend itself to the use of filters. That extending lens and 28mm wide-angle make finding a workable filter system difficult. My solution is a Lensmate G10 58mm adapter and a 58mm extension tube. Together or singly they allow a Cokin filter holder to be used at all focal lengths.

     <Review>I am a confirmed digital Canon customer having owned a 640 and a G7 before this model. The G10 is new, my experience is with the G7, but I expect the the G10 to hold to the same, or better standards as it is quite similar. I used (and sometimes abused) the G7 for ethnographic field work and it held up remarkably well. I make frequent use of the flash shoe with a canon flash with excellent results. I note that some other makes offer this now. But this is still the only camera in its category to make sound recordings, as well as video clips, both of which I also find very useful. For my purposes the battery life is quite adequate although I generally carry two spares. I very rarely use the second spare and think I&apos;ll go without it on the new model. Unfortunately Canon has decided to go with ... a bigger battery this model, probably to power the bigger view screen. I would have been quite happy with the old set-up. [...] MAC USERS BEWARE. The camera&apos;s programs require OS10.4 or higher, NOT the advertised OS9 and above. the Canon site is also confusing on this point. Overall excellent camera.

     <Review>I have used the Canon Gs for many years and the new Canon G10 is the best small P&amp;S digital camera ever. This small Canon can do a lot in getting you quality colorful pictures. It&apos;s fast starting with a large easy to view screen. It&apos;s a strong build with easy to use controls. It&apos;s new larger battery give a longer life span then the older Gs. I really like my new Canon G10 and you will also.</Review>

     <Review>to be fair, i haven&apos;t used this camera near enough to claim any expertise and i&apos;m definitely a beginner photog, so bare that in mind: i&apos;m still working my way thru the manual on this thing. so far the pics look good, but too much grain in low light. the controls are not intuitive and are hard to manuever for big hands like mine. still, it&apos;s jam-packed with features (and megapixels). and it&apos;s very rugged and easy to carry around when you don&apos;t want to deal with changing lenses. the battery life is very good.</Review>

I have used the Canon G10 now for the last 3 weeks on vacation. The picture quality, lens, controls, LCD screen, overall quality and control are excellent. This camera is for the Enthusiast or semi pro who does not want to carry a 35mm size camera but wants top quality and and manual and automatic control.</Review>

     <Review>Pros: Easy To Use; Easy to Keep Clean; Bright LCD; Great Picture Quality; Comfortable Controls; Strong Construction; Easy Setup

Cons: Mode Switch Location

This camera can turn even the novice into a pro. Chocked full of user friendly features that allow the photographer to custom taylor their needs. Super Sharp 3&quot; LCD display. RAW file format along with JPEG simultaneously. Super crisp images, that can be put to super size prints without losing essential definition (14.7 MP to the rescue). 

The only drawback to the package is the mode switch is located on top of the ISO dial which can lead to accidental change in ISO when changing the mode dial.</Review>

     <Review>I love the handling, controls and the overall feel of this camera. The G10 is very sturdy camera. Things I love about the G10: Feel, controls, bright light shots, macro, landscape and flash portraits indoors. The G10 weighs next to nothing in comparison to the DSLR&apos;s. You will have a lot of creative control but this isn&apos;t a DSLR replacement camera. Things I wish Canon would have improved: I would have liked to have had HD video along with better noise control at ISO&apos;s at 400 and above. I really would have liked to have had the lens length of the G9 with the wide-angle lens capability of the G10. That would have made the decision a no brainer. Personally, I almost returned the G10. I was disatisfied with it&apos;s low light, no flash shots. Then I just had to look at it and say, It&apos;s ... not a DSLR...it&apos;s an excellent point and shoot camera. I do believe the G10 is the most controllable, best handling camera in the Advanced Point and Shoot category. I have seen some G10 shots online and can only say that just about everything is attainable with this little camera. It just depends on your willingless to accept it isn&apos;t a DSLR. Overall recommendation - Keep it. I am keeping mine. Once I realized I was asking a bit much from this little guy....I cut him some slack and have been much happier every since. Looking at the pics on-line from the G10, I can say I have some learning to do. This camera is capable and I&apos;m just learning how to make it work for me.

     <Review>Pros: Bright LCD; Great Picture Quality; Comfortable Controls; Easy To Use; Strong Construction

Not on par with an SLR, but an excellent point and shoot. A little bulky at first, but I soon got used to it. The images came out bright and clear. Great choice for somebody not willing to lug around a lot of camera gear. The battery life was good and the stabilizer works great. Focusing is fast and accurate even in low light. And I just love the big clear LCD.</Review>

     <Review>I like the super big lcd although the strong point is shooting in bright ambient because high iso is too noisy. this is a ccd not a cmos chip. flash definitely helps in low light. this version took away the time lapse feature which disappointed me. the wider lens is a good factor and so is the quick +/- dial. slightly bulky but a serious camera cannot be too small.</Review>

     <Review>I&apos;m a professional photojournalist who travels regularly on assignment and this is the camera I ALWAYS have with me, especially when I&apos;m done working and I go out for dinner or drinks. This is probably my 6th Canon G camera and it&apos;s the best so far. I just sold my G9 about a month ago. The time from power on to shoot is the shortest ever, not a DSLR but pretty darn fast. Image quality is great up to iso200 and good up to iso400. From there on, you&apos;d need some kind of noise reduction software but in jam iso800 would do. No it doesn&apos;t shoot HD video but then again, I bought a still camera, if I wanted HD video I woulda bought a vid cam that shot stills...</Review>

     <Review>I&apos;ve had many digital cameras after migrating from film. All were like toys, a few got close to giving me what I wanted, a camera that handled and shot like a 35mm rangefinder. One that had feel and weight with great optics. Well, this is the one. Flexibility that allows me to shoot, no create pictures with all the adjustments I could want or shoot auto to grab that quick snapshot with no lag! And B&amp;H is best place to buy it!</Review>

     <Review>I&apos;ve had quite a few digital cameras since they first were offered. Most were either Canon or Nikon but there has been a sampling of Sony, Casio and Panasonic. They have been 3x to 12x, one megapixel to 10. And as an old 35mm photog I thought I would never find a camera to satisfy my craving for a rangefinder camera with lots of manual adjustments. Don&apos;t misunderstand, point and shoots are quick, easy and grab those quick document shots, but to explore the reaches of creativity an adjustable camera is necessary. Digi-slr are great but still heavy and are more difficult to grab that never to get shot. The G-10 has solved my craving. It can be used in auto for those quick shots and has all of the adjustability to create a picture. Making pictures instead of taking pictures. The opti ... cs are superb, lag between pictures, quick enough to feel like a 35mm camera. The zoom range is adequate enough and the picture quality is just wonderful. So to say it simply, I am in love! It is the best all around camera I have ever owned. Yes, it is a little heavier than other digitals but the weight is worth the other advantages and it feels like a camera should-stable. I have just commenced on a self-assignment (suggested by my son)to create photos of my Staten Island. Over the years some of my photos have received acclaim for capturing the emotion of inadament scenes around my island home. The G is deffinately suited for that assignment as well as my ungoing one of cataloguing my grandkids as they grow older.

     <Review>I bought the G10 after I brought my S60 out of retirement for an afternoon party at a friend&apos;s house, and it became obvious from the pictures that there have been improvements in technology since the last time I used it. The G10 won&apos;t fit in your shirt pocket, but since I carry a purse, and it fits nicely inside that, I&apos;m fine with its size. Under almost all conditions it takes beautifully sharp and clear shots. It&apos;s perfect for taking travel and family photos. My main gripe is the shutter lag and the slow burst mode. I&apos;m spoiled by my 40D. I&apos;ve gotten interested in street photography, and the G10 disappoints me in this area. On the other hand, for things like landscapes, seascapes, sunrises, groups of friends, etc. it really delivers.Another gripe I have is the size of its files. ... I shoot RAW, and I only get about 200 shots on a 4 gig card. My computer (about a year old) takes its own sweet time about downloading and processing G10 files. Also, at this writing (11/20/08), CS3 Camera Raw doesn&apos;t recognize the G10. The software that comes with the camera is OK, but it&apos;s not Photoshop. Having said all that, I&apos;m very happy with my purchase. The quality of the shots are just as good as those of my 40D, and it&apos;s a lot lighter to haul around. If only they could speed up the shutter response.

     <Review>The raw feature on this camera make professional life a breeze. I can take this around and use it for small magazine quality photos and beautiful personal images. the body is strong and handsome. It can replace all my other cameras on most fun outings. And if there were a shot that I could use for work, well, the RAW setting would allow me to use it for that too! Its so versatile, I just love it.</Review>

     <Review>Pros: So many pixals, shoots RAW, fun shooting modes

Cons: Almost too small

I can&apos;t believe Canon has packed so much in this camera. It&apos;s like the &quot;big boys&quot; without carrying all the lenses. Could possibly use more telephoto, but there is a lot to offer at this price point.</Review>

     <Review>I use this on my Canon G-10 to bring the far photos a little closer and enhance the detail on them. It is not going to extend your range by much on the telephoto end of the G-10, but the pictures will be much clearer, allowing you to resize and crop for that zoomed-in look. It works best in bright light, but you will have to stop it down so the bright areas of your picture don&apos;t blow out. For the super crystal clear shots, I use a monopod or tripod, but handheld still works pretty well. The down side to this lens is that you get serious vinetting when you zoom in with the lens still attached, so you can&apos;t just leave it on the camera full-time. That&apos;s a shame, because it is handy for the long shots. It seems to be solidly built, but the weight doesn&apos;t really affect the balance of th ... e G-10. For what I bought it for (extending the G-10 telephoto range a little, and making those far shots a little clearer so you can enlarge and crop later, it is worth the money I spent. I&apos;m happy with it. It could have gotten 5 stars if it had threads for filters, but it doesn&apos;t so no filters.

     <Review>The macro lens is very sharp! This is however the only use I have had with this bundle. When using the Wide lens for wide shots th image gets cut in all corners so you get a tube shot... not very nice. G12</Review>

     <Review>Pros: Easy to Use, Fast Shutter Speed, Fast start up, Good Battery Life, Good sized screen, Great Resolution, Great Zoom, Nice Features and Settings A friend recommended the G10 to me. I have a couple of cheaper digital cameras and they do not perform to my expectation. The G10 takes great pictures and is easy to use. The only issue is close-up shots. It is hard to focus. It take a little experimenting with to get it down. Well worth the money for the features and quality.</Review>

     <Review>Pros: Compact for pants pocket, Excellent in Low Light, Fast Shutter Speed, Good Battery Life, Good sized screen, Great Resolution, Great Zoom, Nice Features and Settings ... Cons: Complicated Controls When the time came to replace our SD400 due to inadvertent water damage, the difficult choice was between a compact camera and an SLR. We definitely wanted to be able to take better pictures than with a pocket-size camera, after regretting that we took our old SD 400 on a safari. However, we still wanted a camera that can easily be schlepped around to hiking and climbing trips, as every pound counts. We finally decided on the G10 as a compromise and so far we have not been disappointed. The case is sturdy and protects the camera on our trips. It&apos;s multitude of settings gives almost SLR-like ... capabilities. The only downside I would see is that if you really want to use those nifty features, they are likely a bit more difficult to use than with an SLR. Having said that, I have taken pretty decent night pictures with this camera and some trying and tweaking, and have used maybe a third or half of the camera features here and there. Except for those special scenes and occasions, however, I just use the automatic mode. The 5x zoom might not be as strong as other hi-zoom cameras. However, those are typically larger (see introduction). If I needed a higher zoom factor, I just shoot in highest-resolution and crop the image later (my default setting is 5MP anyway). Picture quality is great from all I can tell. Reaction time (shutter lag?) is excellent, especially when you prime the camera by pressing the release button down halfway. All in all, I am very happy with this camera and recommend it to people who need better quality than pocket cameras can offer but who don&apos;t want to spend $800+ or need a more compact camera.

Cons: Grip I have experienced NO shutter at start up or on the fly with this camera. The zoom and auto focus features are fool proof. The integrity of the shot in low lite or sunlite is superb. The fall colours I&apos;m capturing with this camera are excellent. I&apos;m still getting used to my new acquistion but so far so GOOD.</Review>

     <Review>I carry this camera everywhere. Whats good about the camera is the quality of the pictures, quick shutter. It has the features of a 35mm camera. the only problem with the camera is the size. it&apos;s a little big but I still wear it on my hip.</Review>

     <Review>The images are blurred and I don&apos;t think the IS is working. Took it to Canon Service Center and they replaced the lens element and said they brought it to factory specs. The image jumps around on the LCD, so much for IS. Nothing like my Sony. I bought a kit for B&amp;H for over $600 dollars. Will probably give it to my grandkids.I used to love Canon, but this has put a sour taste in my mouth.</Review>

     <Review>Great for street and close up photography. Excellent light backup for my DSLR. Image quality exceeded my expectations after reading about noise at ISO settings above 100. I have excellent results with ISO 200 and 400 and very usable images above that. I use Av mode and have easy access to the controls that I need: Zoom, Aperture, Exposure Compensation, and ISO. Other important controls (flash, closeup, focus area shift) require one additional click to select the control. The main problem is the relatively-long time between shots, so it&apos;s not a camera for action photography. As with most small cameras, it&apos;s hard to separate the subject from the background with a shallow depth of field.</Review>

     <Review>I was considering a SLR. I have friends that are professional photographers. They raved about this and told me that I can still point and shoot while learning what i might do with an SLR. It will give me a chance to figure out if I really am going to be a decent photographer. The color is fantastic. The options for various modes have been excellent and helped me take good photos. The opportunity to override aperture and shutter speed has made for some fun learning. Once I own it a bit longer, there are flashes and a telephoto lens that I can purchase.</Review>

     <Review>Pros: Exceptionally clear shots, macro pictures

Cons: Hefty price tag

I was looking around for awhile for a good camera for a starting block into photography. I originally thought I was going to get the Nikon P90 because of its big MP and 24x zoom, but after I saw a side by side comparison with this G10, I was amazed. The amount of clarity and detail in pictures is great, and you wont get bored messing with all the different settings and adjustments possible. Another draw to this camera for me was the options to add on with accessories. Aftermarket lens (telephoto and wide angle) packages can be had on ebay for under $150; that will be my next investment. Overall I&apos;m happy with my investment!</Review>

Cons: Long Lag Time

Great for nature and family photos. Macro is superb. I shoot mostly in RAW format so lag between shots is a problem even with a fast card. There are so many options that I would NOT recommend it for beginners. I have been shooting constantly for three weeks and have not been through all of the shooting modes. Money was well spent. I also ordered the 58MM lens adapter which is a must have item.</Review>

     <Review>Pros: excellent photos; rugged construction; raw file type

Canon g10; A great alternative to your SLR!

I normal take my Canon T1i SLR on trips for taking photos and the one off video. However, there are times when I cant carry the SLR around. I have found that the Canon G10 is a great alternative for taking photos in these type of situations.

It has its similarities to the SLR and then its differences. Obviously unlike an SLR you cannot change out lenses but the built in lens has enough zoom range to take some great shots and not leave you wanting an additional lens.

The construction of the camera is tough enough and the availability of a hotshoe for an external flash make it conducive for taking photos in low light.

It also has photo recording in RAW for ... mat so if you like to do editing work, it helps.

All in all we have been very happy with this purchase!

     <Review>If you are shooting in a fairly dark area and you&apos;ve set auto ISO and expect the camera to set a high enough ISO to take a pic, it won&apos;t do it. The ISO jumps to 200 and the red camera on the display flashes, which tells you the shutter speed is so low you&apos;ll probably get movement in the shot. The Canon engineers were aware that shooting at Higher ISO numbers will introduce excessive noise, they fixed it so you have to manually set a higher ISO and accept the results.</Review>

Cons: nothing

I wanted an slr camera but didn&apos;t want to deal with the size and I wanted something my wife could easily use. I was sick of the picture quality of most compact cameras. This thing is perfect for us and the picture quality is as good as some slrs I&apos;ve seen. It&apos;s a bit pricey but worth every penny, we&apos;ve taken some amazing shots already. Another great thing is how fast it is, hit the power button and it&apos;s ready to go. I think i&apos;m a canon fan for life.</Review>

     <Review>It handles like a Retina IIa with a zoom lens, 800 asa color and instant review gratification. What&apos;s not to like? As a snap-shot tourist, I like that its lighter and less likely to attract attention than my SLR. Lacks the low level light capability of my SLR, but available light at ASA 800 with it isn&apos;t any worse than pushed 35 mm film. I haven&apos;t actually printed anything yet, so I may get a surprise, but it does look good blown up in photoshop, and certainly viewed on the computer. The camera does have image stablization, and the Leica IIIf everybody wants to compare it to sure didn&apos;t. On the whole, a nice piece of glass.</Review>

     <Review>Pros: Great Picture Quality; Easy Setup; Easy To Use; Strong Construction; Comfortable Controls; Easy to Keep Clean; Bright LCD

Cons: A bit heavy

I had been using both a Canon film SLR camera and a smaller digital point and shoot Camera for many years. The Canon G10 has replaced both. It is just slightly larger than the point and shoot, yet it has all the functions of my film SLR. Like the SLR, it&apos;s very well built and actually many of the SLR accessories (flash, remote, etc...) can be used with the G10. Picture quality is amazing even in low light. Colors are rich, pictures are sharp, noise is low. Pictures look extremely realistic with good depth. The LCD screen is large and bright. Battery life is much better than expected. Overall, I think this is a great camera.</Review>

     <Review>Excellent, really well built and takes fantastic pictures. Easy to use in auto but enough features to let you take complete control if you want to. A perfect camera if you want something better than point-and-shoot but don&apos;t want to go the whole way to DSLR</Review>

     <Review>Well I puchased this item thinking it would enhance photos I was after with my kids soccer and triathlon events I attend. Have to say I am no professional when it comes to taking photos but it just seems as if this lense really makes the photos grainy and am still working through this. I havent given up but I really thought this would be an easy add on to use. I will say it does add a few more feet to capturing photos at a distance. I dont like the adapter and find it almost a hender. I wish Cannon would have made it one piece considering they dont do any other lenses for the g10. Rather you have to purchase the adapter and the lense to make this work. As well, I wish they provided a hard case to slip the factory installed g10 lense when using this adapter and tele lense. All you get is ... a small bag.

     <Review>i use this as my always-carry-with-me camera, as well as location backup-camera-in-case-everything-goes-wrong. ergonomics is well-thought, menus are self-explanatory 90% of the time (10% would be the time i accidentally turned my on-camera flash off permanently¬ being able to reverse it yet). it feels good in hand, buttons are the right size for my medium-sized hands. plenty of dedicated buttons, ev adjustment knob is extremely helpful. lcd is great, bright, crisp &amp; big. it can easily be used with off-camera flash via a cord(or on-camera with no cord, if you really wish so), and can save the day for an assignment. really. lens get fairly wide(better than g9), and covers a pretty good range. low-light performance is pretty bad, i try not to go over 400 iso at all. though this is ... expected, as it is still a point&amp;shoot camera, with the same guts of a smaller canon sd...as such, don&apos;t expect too much if you intend to shoot moving subjects (i.e. your newborn or your puppy) with no flash. but here, it shines from the point&amp;shoots, because of the hot-shoe socket on the top: if you don&apos;t mind the extra weight, pop an external flash in there and you&apos;re golden. one pet peeve of mine is the fact that i haven&apos;t been able to find a tight-fitting sleeve for it: most are either too small or too bulky. so i carry it naked, which does make conscious of the camera at all times, a negative for me. it replaced my tiny canon ex for me, added much more flexibility, a bit of bulk(that i don&apos;t mind), and no extra low-light capability. if you are looking for a pocket camera, this is not it. i&apos;d get an sd-xxx if that&apos;s the case. if you are looking for a solution that will enable you to leave the dslr at home on casual trips and you want to get a little involved with your snaps, this is it; with a bonus of doubling as a occasionally used backup camera to your dslr, that also has video capabilities for casual occasions. my d700 is mostly at home now, for those times i mentioned above, and assignments. when i think i may get a little more serious, i grab my d40x. overall, i am a happy camper.

     <Review>I use this camera for travel, fun and anytime I do not want to carry one of my dslr bodies. This camera has great IQ up to ISO 400 and acceptable up to 1600 and a useful and quality zoom of approx 28-140. I was amazed at the quality of images and very pleased with the build. There are many dslr features on this camera or you can use it like any other p&amp;s. I would rec a hotshoe flash like the Canon 270 or even larger if you prefer. I have used the 270 which is great for 90% of flash photography and also one of my 580s with great results. Great little camera! Get one and enjoy.</Review>

     <Review>I have three other Canon cameras: a 30D, a 50D and a 5D Mark II, and I bought this camera to have something I could carry easily in my pocket. The G10 is well-built, flexible, and has a good lens. It should be top-flight point-and-shoot. However, it takes great pictures at ISO 80 or 100 but digital noise begins to become noticeable even at ISO 200. The 25.3 Mpx/cm2 pixel density of its small sensor is the problem. I wish Canon had resisted the marketing appeal of more megapixels and instead concentrated on image quality at higher ISOs so that this camera would be more useful in low-light situations. I had also hoped to use the G-10 (and the LA-DC58K lens adapter) for digiscoping with a Swarovski scope but discovered that it would not work because of severe vignetting when coupled to the sc ... ope. Eventually I decided to return the camera.

     <Review>This is a great little package! I am coming from a 5D and 24-70L, so wasn&apos;t expecting full-frame pro-glass IQ, but have been very impressed. I think the most impressive aspect is just how versatile this camera is. I travel a LOT and this is so much easier to carry than my 5D, and gives me pictures I wouldn&apos;t get with my 5D, because I&apos;d never take the 5D out in as many on the fly situations. So, that in itself is worth it, just because I&apos;m getting more shots now. Image quality is fantastic if you can keep the ISO down. Features are great, but take a little getting used to (can&apos;t be as quick with them as you can on a DSLR in most cases). Love the fact that it can be used manually, and even works with my speedlights. Video is such a nice feature to have, and so easy to use. Would lov ... e HD video, but this does the trick, and has great quality (just don&apos;t zoom in while shooting video because the quality really degrades a ton - but that&apos;s pretty typical). Overall a fantastic little package for getting great shots, remaining stealth, and still enjoying the true aspects of photography. Not an SLR, but it&apos;s not supposed to be...which is also why I bought it.

The ergonomics could be better. Holding the camera can feel somewhat awkward, and it takes 2 hands to do nearly everything. I am going to fix this problem by purchasing lens attachement accessories from lensmate... Then I will have more to hold on to.</Review>

     <Review>Great little camera, now I don&apos;t have to lug my 1D MKII around, but I still will at times. The macro on this thing is incredible, you can set the lens right on top of your subject. It even shoots pretty good video. The display on the LCD is awesome, nice and bright. Still has the shutter lag that I really don&apos;t like and I make fun of when I&apos;m using my 1D.</Review>

     <Review>I am in absolute love with my g10 and try to convince anyone in the market its the best purchase they&apos;ll ever make. I&apos;ve already converted two of my photography friends and they love me for it. I bought this camera after hearing rave reviews from a friend who owns a g9. I thought why not give it a try. I was going on a ten day trip to Paris and didn&apos;t really want to lug around my 5d. It was deff. the right choice and will be used from now on when I travel. The great perks (which I could seriously go on and on about each one for hours) about the g10 is the 14.7 mega pixels, large view moniter, amazing video capture, I&apos;m able to change ISO/exposure compensation in a flash and it offers everything my 5d has but without the bulk and lens worry. The lens on the g10 is great too with some of the ... best zoom I&apos;ve seen yet. I also like how the settings I use the most are on the top of the camera like that of an old slr. Plus you don&apos;t have to keep going into your menu to change your settings. Also another cool feature is you can dial down your flash exposure if needed. Even at 1600 ISO it still performs at its best with little noise. The g10 is like old world charm with new world technology. Plus you can purchase underwater housing for it for less than $200 bucks!Canon really out did themselves this time around. I&apos;ve owned a lot of snapshot cameras in the past but this one takes the cake. It is a great travel companion because its not intimidating like a big SLR, but it still looks like a professional camera. This G10 is for sure my 007 of cameras.

I love this camera. I carry it with me wherever I go. I have both a Canon 20D and Elph and this is the perfect blend of both. 

I especially love the size. Small enough to carry everywhere but big enough to feel substantial. Reminds me of a Leica CL.</Review>

     <Review>I replaced my Nikon D40 with a Canon G9 and loved the capabilities it offered. Now, I didn&apos;t need separate lenses to carry along or a bulky DSLR body while I traveled. BUT, I still retained my full manual control, exposure bracketing, RAW, etc. I do lots of landscapes while traveling, so I needed to go wider - the G10 offered that and more, with a bigger battery, better grip, and the awesome exposure control dial! Anything above ISO80 can get scketchy, but at 80, it&apos;s awesome. IS is key when you are without a tripod or anything else to brace the camera on. Even the video quality is good - better than the Flip Video camera at times, but nice to have. Haven&apos;t used the flash - wouldn&apos;t recommend it anyway. This is the perfect camera for the photo enthusiast who needs something more ... compact for travel.

     <Review>I took this camera on a recent trip to Cambodia and it has been terrific. I am far from a professional photographer but got a lot of incredible shots, using all kinds of settings. I really like the easy accessibility of the settings, so that, even as an amateur, I can play with the different modes to find the best shots. I didn&apos;t think the extra megapixels would make a big difference but I took some photos while on a boat trip and when I zoomed in was able to see all kinds of details that I hadn&apos;t even noticed before. And they were still clear. I liked being able to edit size (and red eye) on the camera itself as I was sharing my images with friends along the way. At this point, I only have points to make in favor of this. I also ran into a crew making a documentary who asked to check ... out my G10 as they were hoping to get one for themselves.

     <Review>This is my first digital camera. I only shot film prior. I have been back and forth about switching to digital but was tired of carrying around an slr. The G9 caught my attention and the G10 put me over the edge. Great manual controls in easy locations to maneuver. Very bright viewing screen. And there is virtually no lag time when you press the shutter like most digital cameras have. Even when using flash. Absolutely the best camera if you want digital but don&apos;t want to lug an slr around.</Review>

     <Review>I bought this camera for underwater use in an Ikelite Housing. I own a Nikon D200 and Ikelite housing but you are limited by the lens you use underwater. No current zoom lenses for the Nikon have this zoom range PLUS THE MACRO CAPABILITIES, and fit the Ikelite ports. After using the camera topside for the past 3 weeks alongside my Nikon D200 I must say I am very impressed with this little camera!!! It understandably exhibits more noise than the Nikon, but if you shoot RAW and remove the noise you can get remarkably close to the Nikon. If you are looking for more features and better image quality than most of the small cheaper cameras, this might just be your camera. Having the dedicated exposure compensation wheel on top of the camera is a real PLUS. Note that this camera does NOT h ... ave a BULB setting (shame on you Canon.)

     <Review>About the only thing I found flaw with this camera is the images it produced. It just happened to be the most important thing. Canon has built the best looking, most functional (all most useful buttons are in the right places), best feels, which is the case of this camera. But the images are way below expectation. I must have a bad copy of this camera, because I just flat did not get the image quality I was looking for, did not matter how much I tweaked it. I shot it with default setting, auto and custom WB, exposure adjustment, auto and custom ISO, Av, Tv mode, every setting known to man. I could say that its images are worse than those I took with my old Canon A620. Very soft and noise is visible in any ISO speed. Long lag time and long shot to shot time. I used a Sandisk Extreme III SD ... card, and it was still slow! Everyone who has this camera loved it. I loved it too. I would try to live with some of its faults, if not for the low quality of images it produced.

     <Review>What an awesome camera!!!!!!! I&apos;m a long time pro Nikon Shooter and was so tired of dragging many pounds of equipment with me on vacations. But quality absolutely had to be there for me to leave my SLR&apos;s at home. Since I don&apos;t shoot sports on vacations a compact camera seemed the way to go. Compact cameras like this do have a shutter lag(time it takes to actually take the picture after the release button is pushed)...this can be a problem for fast moving subjects but with some practice most other types of photography can be done very successfully. I was tempted to go with the Nikon P6000 till I saw the test image results, and I was sold on the Canon G10. One of the main things I needed the camera to do is be self sufficient..meaning... no extra lenses and accessories. The 28mm wide angl ... e is BEAUTIFUL and finally what I needed to convert me over to a compact camera, and it has an oustanding macro capability too...Oh so convenient. Then I found out that the optical zoom has a special in-camera cropping feature that can zoom to: 140mm at 15 megapixel (16x24 at 200dpi), 180mm at 9 megapixel (12x17 at 200dpi) or 238mm at 5 megpixel (8x10 at 200dpi)... AMAZING...who needs that cumbersome and expensive add on teleconverter when the camera can do it optically in camera just by reducing the megapixels some. I also love the rugged feel and quality of this camera and it&apos;s not so small that I can&apos;t hold it comfortably. Controls just like the pro SLR&apos;s. Then there is more...the super sharp and clear 3 inch monitor has finally switched me over from looking thru viewfinders. The flash is just powerfull enough for most general shooting needs especially since I tend to use flash more for Fill ...using ambient light for the main exposure. The results are simply STUNNING. Then if all that wasn&apos;t enough..this camera can also do movies up to One Hour or 4 Gig whichever comes first...How in the world did they pack all of this in this fanastic camera. What more can I say but ABSOLUTELY AMAZING... I love it so much that I just purchased another Canon G10. Congratulations Canon...you have a winner.

     <Review>Pros: Pictue quality, features, battery life

Cons: price

I bought this camera during the after Christmas sales last year. I am very happy with it so far. I have been needing a new camera for a long time. I needed something to take everyday pictures with and then something to take precise reference images for CG modeling, and textures. It took me about a week to fully understand every feature and setting on the camera. All this is an amazing camera, I wouldn&apos;t buy this camera unless you have a need for the settings it provides. For everyday picture taking I would suggest the Canon Powershot SD990 IS, this camera has the same quality pictures without all the complex settings.</Review>

     <Review>Pros: Takes fantastic photos. Easy to use, light weight, many options for special effects. Has RAW image mode, so it&apos;s great for Photo Shop.

I wanted a camera that would take great photos and have many options for special effects, etc., but did not want a big, heavy and expensive SLR again. This camera offers all the features of an SLR, but without the weight and price. I LOVE it!</Review>

     <Review>I was less than happy with this lens. I ended up returning it and buying a Raynox DCR-1541PRO. The Raynox has 67mm filter threads in front, the TC-DC58D does not. Plus the Raynox is a 1.54x vs. Canon&apos;s 1.4x. The glass is not bad and it works just fine there are just better options.</Review>

     <Review>There are so many things to shoot in New York City and having this camera is great. You can carry it around and functions are similar to DSLR and very comparable to low end DSLRs. I take pictures of just about everything and I use this a lot with my photo clubs photo trips. I dont have much things against this camera except that I needed to learn how to use the dial quickly. I also wish that the low light functions but other than that, it&apos;s a great camera. This is probably the best point and shoot digital camera I ever used.</Review>

     <Review>Pros: High Quality ... Cons: Expensive I have found this camera to be rewarding and frustrating. I bought it because I wanted the manual abilities, and I wanted a camera that would give stellar image quality without the bulk of an SLR to haul around. It works okay for snapshots with friends and such, but really isn&apos;t ideal for night-out quick snapshots like other cameras are. Its autofocus button is sensitive and hard to get used to, you will end up having it take the picture annoyingly when you were jut trying to autofocus. The controls are cool, I like the design, and its comfortable to use for prolonged periods. Overall, if I had it to do over again I&apos;d buy an SLR, and just cough up the money and then buy a cheapie camera for snapshots. This camera will give you excellent images in its ... category, but ultimately you will be frustrated because its just not up to the standards of an SLR.

     <Review>As a amateur photographer back in the day, I put out pretty decent black and white work in my home dark room, using my Nikon FTN. So, I have some knowledge of aperture, shutter speed, etc. In choosing my next digital, I wanted something with more manual control like I had then, especially focus.I figured I&apos;ll get a state of the art SLR when I retire. For now, I wanted something close to an SLR. So far, I love this camera. If you have the patience, you can mimic an SLR with the G10. Takes great pictures. The only drawbacks are, that with a boxers&apos; hands, the little focusing ring and buttons are a bit tough to manage, but that&apos;s just me. It also is a bit large for a point and shoot. You&apos;re not slipping this baby into your shirt pocket or the inside pocket of a sport coat unless you want to l ... ook like you&apos;re packing. So, even though the G10is a no brainer in automatic mode, I may get a low end elph just so my wife doesn&apos;t murder me when we go to a wedding or some occasion and I tell her to put the G10 in her purse. All in all, having done some research and huddling up with the knowledgable counter guys at B&amp;H....the G10 is the one you want...

     <Review>I was looking for a camera that was small enough to take almost anywhere but had the features and image quality of a DSLR, and I think I found it in the G10. A key for me was having a wide-angle lens, and although the 28mm (35mm equivalent) isn&apos;t huge-wide, it&apos;s wide enough for me to shoot in fairly tight quarters. I know that megapixels aren&apos;t everything, but combined with the brilliant lens and a very high level of control for a compact, the shots are great. The only thing--and I&apos;m learning how to avoid this--is that its a bit tricky to grip the camera without covering the AF assist beam or the flash. The thing is so packed full of features that there&apos;s not much surface for your hands.</Review>

     <Review>I wanted a compact camera that I wouldn&apos;t get tired of carrying around all day on vacation trips. I&apos;m also spoiled by the image quality of my DSLR so I needed something that could produce quality images I&apos;d be happy to show my friends and family. This camera has not let me down. I also love the quality of the rear LCD display. It&apos;s bright and has pleasing color tones.</Review>

     <Review>What I love about the G10 are the features of an DSLR with a point &amp; shoot camera. A friend of mine already got a couple of our friends to purchase the G10. Great camera for money!</Review>

     <Review>Pros: Manual Control, Shoots RAW

Cons: Unreliable metering, Awful photos

I am a big fan of Canon. I have bought many Canon cameras for myself and my family. I had the previous model the Canon G9 which was excellent.
The camera went kaput, and I replaced it with the newer G10. The new camera now has a wide angle lens but Canon cut back the zoom range on it.
I did like the added telephoto on the G9 but the wide angle is more practical.
The camera is slightly bigger than the G9 and some of the controls on top have been changed. When I first got the camera I was very happy with it but then the camera started underexposing shots and I lost some good ones. Maybe the camera was defective but I had read other reviews about this too. Even though I could go in and MAYBE tweak ... the exposure manually, why should I ?
When I can use a much less expensive camera and get a beautifully exposed image I expect the same from a high end camera.
The movie format was also changed from the G9 , supposedly better but I thought it was awful. I also have a Canon SD 770, 10 MP camera which blew the G10 out of the water. Now I am not trying to compare these two cameras as the G10 is so much more camera in terms of shooting RAW and complete manual control, etc. I took the camera back to Best Buy very disappointed with it. When it got the exposure right it was beautiful but when it didn&apos; t I missed some good people shots that could not be done over. I shot with flash, no flash and every which way. I know my way around cameras. Although I shoot for pleasure, I am also a published photographer. Very disappointed !

     <Review>The G10 is perfect for what I was looking for. More control than a basic point and shoot, but not as many bells and whistles - and smaller and cheaper - than a true SLR. The picture quality is fantastic. The response time is also very good. Unless I have the red-eye reduction on, or quick repetitive flash required shots, there is very little time lag. I have been taking lots of candid shots of kids, and that is always the trouble cause they tend to only be cute for a second or two. The various scene options and the built in editing were also a great surprise. I did not buy the camera for these features, but found myself playing with the options and very happy with how quick and easy it was to do, especially trimming and fixing red eye. Another feature is that this camera feels like a came ... ra. Has a solid construction, good grip, and just enough heft to it to feel stable. The camera wasn&apos;t cheap, but I definitely feel I got the features I paid for, and still several hundred cheaper than an SLR. Very Happy.

     <Review>Pros: Great camera and functionality. Has easy point and shoot with great picture quality but also has all the features you would expect from a nice SLR.

Cons: Haven&apos;t found any.

     <Review>If you are looking for a powerful point and shoot - get the G10. Great exposure and color balance. the two complains I have are - No raw on full auto? and the lens is dog slow 2.7 max I was out on a windy day by the water at dusk and I would not get one clear exposure. But if you are familiar with Canon point and shoots - you will not even need to crack the manual - come to think of it - perhaps I should.</Review>

     <Review>I use this camera as a backup to my Digital SLR&apos;s, With the wider lens I photograph interiors and architecture. The self timer gives you 3 exposures and catches your subjects in great expressions. Easy to carry. Good in low light situations,i.e. the museum. Always purchase another battery! For being 1/3 the cost of a D-SLR the performance and image quality are great.</Review>

     <Review>Love the easy to use picture modes. Twice the megapixels than anybody needs besides a professional. Battery life is great. Great macro and wide angle shots with outstanding resolution. The color and saturation from this camera is what I&apos;ve come to expect from Canon and it beats all the other competitors. I like to shoot in RAW mode and this camera does that.</Review>

     <Review>This is a great camera. Image quality is first rate and it handles like my leica of decades ago. Inobtrusive and quick, it handles candid photography with ease, but the LCD facilitates careful composition for my macro, scenic and archetectural work. Being sealed means no dust problems and less time in Photoshop. There are only two things I would change. The zoom control is too fast(!) and should restart at the last used setting. If that were fixed and the optical finder showed just a bit more of the frame, it would be perfect. I love it.</Review>

     <Review>Permit a loose analogy that illustrates the outcome when a company has a good basic design that is iteratively refined over the years. The VW was notable for great design and reliability; such is the case with the Canon G series. Almost intuitive to use, it makes photography fun again. With the G10 you have more control than you ever thought possible, and the basics are only a dial turn away. I purchased the camera as a compact alternative to my DSLR to accompany me on an overseas business trip. It&apos;s a lot of camera for the money!</Review>

     <Review>Pros: Durable, High Quality A great second camera if you own a digital SLR and like using software to adjust before printing. It is far more portable and the quality is excellent. I have taken night shots and find it easy to reduce the noise with Photoshop. The hot shoe for an external flash is super since all small, in-camera flashes are extremely weak</Review>

     <Review>Pros: Easy to use, looks great out doors

Cons: Quality, price, short battery life

I would not recommend this product. You have to steady the camera on like a ledge or something, set it to the 10 second mode &apos;till it takes a pic, and stand VERY still in order for it to just come out fairly decent. Other then that, even if you hold it and take a picture, it comes out horribly blurry. In doors, it makes the picture come out orange, and very odd looking. The only setting that makes the picture come out the clearest, is &quot;flurescent&quot;, but unfortunetly that&apos;s also the most orange looking setting. And on top of it, for how much this product cost, you don&apos;t get your money&apos;s worth at all. Don&apos;t buy it.</Review>
