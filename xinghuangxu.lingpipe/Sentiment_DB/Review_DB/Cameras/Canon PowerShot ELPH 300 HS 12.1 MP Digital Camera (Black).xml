     <Review>The Canon IXUS 300 HS digital camera is somewhat confusing: the HS at the end of its name denotes neither high speed nor high sensitivity. However, it supports both high-speed video capture and has a high sensitivity lens that allows it to take photos in even very low light. Go figure.

Another oddity is that the Canon IXUS 300 HS comes in four colours and several finishes. There&apos;s a black brushed metal version that&apos;s quite grippy and a silver metal version that looks and feels quite different from it. There are also two &apos;exclusive&apos; versions onsale in Jessops and John Lewis respectively, that come in white and red and are ultra-shiny. They look as though they have plastic surrounds but are also actually metal.

Canon IXUS 300 HS: Low-light legend

What is unchanged from a ... ny other Canon Ixus camera we’ve tried is the excellent build and the quality optics. When we first picked up the Canon IXUS 300 HS we were surprised by how heavy it is. At 177g, its solidity is noticeable; in some ways reassuring. There’s a large strip of flash bulb embedded at the top left on the front. Other than that the version we had for review was all black bar splashes of colour denoting the iAuto mode, playback and zoom functions.

Our first test of its mettle was in the suitably dimly lit surroundings of London’s Circus Bar, where a pair of burlesque performers twirled and whirled and performed fire-eating, sword-swallowing and acrobatic feats. A big challenge for a humble compact camera, the Canon IXUS 300 IS was nevertheless able to slip in to low-light mode and produce subtly lit but well-balanced photos that captured the atmosphere.

The performers&apos; constant movements were a challenge for the 3.8x optical zoom, but we got some good shots. The iAuto mode here triggered a rather too bright flash, but with flash deactivated and a high manual ISO setting selected, we were able to get fuzz-free results that weren’t marred by blurring.

Canon IXUS 300 HS: Video functions and special effects

We were also pleasantly surprised by the low-light abilities of the Canon IXUS 300 HS&apos;s video-recording mode. Activated by a simple slider on the top of camera, this captures 720p video and has a likable low-light option so you can play back memorable footage in slow-mo – ideal for action replays. If we had to choose between the Canon&apos;s quality 720p resolution video capture and HS mode or standard speed capture but with 1080 video capture on a lesser-brand camera, we’d choose this every time.

Canon hasn&apos;t gone overboard on the number of settings and special effects you can apply to photos, but there&apos;s a fun diorama effect and some colour swap and colour accent options (the latter two also appear in the video options) that  allow you to have only the primary subject in colour with saturation applied to other objects so they are less prominent. This selection colour option is particularly effective when shooting scenes with lots of distracting items that detract from the main action.

Manual settings are always accessible. With the camera button (denoting manual functions) selected on the top slider, press the central Func Set button on the back to bring up a scrollable options list. Sub-menus for each one then appear. More indepth settings and setup tools fall under the big Menu button on the lower right of the Canon IXUS 300 HS camera – ISO and compression and so on can be adjusted here.

Canon IXUS 300 HS: Outdoor shots

We were fortunate to have some blistering sunshine when testing the Canon IXUS 300 HS outdoors. The result: some brightly coloured shots of sunny London days out worthy of a tourist brochure. Colours popped off the camera&apos;s 3in LCD preview screen and translated just as well to the computer screen. Rainy and overcast days didn’t stop the camera producing pleasing results – greys, blues and off-whites were also pleasingly reproduced, with a good tonal range and impressive accuracy. Importantly, we saw no sign of battery fatigue after three solid days of being out and about shooting (and reviewing onscreen) everything...

     <Review>Little known fact: Canon&apos;s range of digital Ixus cameras turned 10 in May this year.

Since then, cameras such as the Ixus 105 IS and 200 IS have made a huge difference to consumer photography.

The 10-megapixel Canon 300 HS is another step up for pocket-sized photography - a small, beautifully-designed camera with stonking image quality and a massive feature list.

And, with an f/2.0 lens and maximum ISO of 3200, it promises excellent low-light performance.

We&apos;re big fans of the design. As we&apos;ve come to expect from Canon&apos;s glamorous Ixus line, it&apos;s svelte, at 54mm high, and its 100mm width makes it easily pocketable.

The matte black finish on our review model proved a little more divisive, with some concerned it could be more prone to scratches if slipped c ... arelessly into a pocket already occupied by a set of keys.

It does feel well-made, though. The metal chassis feels like it will resist dents and fractures, and although the 300 HS is small, it&apos;s easy to grip without feeling like you&apos;re in danger of dropping it.

The most eye-catching feature on the back of the Canon 300HS is the huge 3-inch, 16:9 widescreen display.

Unsurprisingly, this isn&apos;t the world&apos;s most convenient aspect ratio - the 300 HS, like most compacts, captures images with a 3:2 aspect ratio, which means there&apos;s a fair amount of dead space on the monitor.

On the plus side, this space is cleverly used, keeping shooting information from crowding your composition. There is, however, a 16:9 capture mode, which produces 3,648 x 2,048 images.

The screen itself is a 230,000-dot display, which is par for the course these days, but still, the reputation of Ixus cameras for having bright, sharp displays continues. Indoors or outdoors, we never struggled to make sense of what was going on.

The ELPH 300 HS is the current offering, and chances are you&apos;ve never seen a full-featured camera this thin before.

Reviewers give a big thumbs-up to the Canon PowerShot Elph 300 HS for best-in-class features and performance. As the midline model in Canon&apos;s Elph series, the 4.3-ounce 300 HS is one of the tiniest cameras available with a 5x zoom lens (24mm - 120mm). ...</Review>

     <Review>Pros: Easy to Use, Great shooting modes, Large LCD, Great Value, Sandpaper Finish (no slips), High Megapixel, HD video

As an amateur photographer, I have purchased many digital cameras (both SLR and Point &amp; Shoot). I have always purchased Canon as I prefer their product preferences, quality, value and warranty operations. I recently jumped into a lake with my Canon PowerShot 1300 in my back pocket and had to replace it. It was a costly mistake, but I couldn&apos;t be happier with the result. I did some quick research and found that the best buy/value on a new point and shoot would be this camera (PowerShot HS300). When I got it home I was completely blown away by all of the features that weren&apos;t even advertised on the box. There are multiple shooting modes that can simulate certain s ... hooting modes you can only do with a DSLR. There is a &quot;miniature effect&quot; which shoots like using depth of field or macro focus. There is a &quot;poster effect&quot; which looks like a vignette (which can be done in photoshop), and even color and black and white filtering effect! I couldn&apos;t believe the capabilities this tiny camera packs. It features the fastest processor on the market, takes crisp clear pictures at 12 Mega piels, large 3 inch LCD screen, awesome battery life, and best yet... FULL HD VIDEO! The outer shell of the camera is finished in a way that makes it feel like a fine sandpaper which is great for those like me who frequently drop things or let them slip out of their hand (or pocket). I&apos;ve never been happier with a camera purchase, and for around $225 - $240 you simply can&apos;t beat the value. I would have easily paid over $300 for this camera! Highly recommended to ANYONE in the market for an EXCELLENT camera!

     <Review>Pros: Great Auto adjustment.

Cons: Finish shows scratches easily

This is my first Digital Camera I have purchased. I am used to a SLR with 35mm film or one time use cameras. I enjoy using my cell phone to take pictures but I was looking for something to work better in low light situations. I needed something that could take up close pictures of metal objects with minimum effect from the flash. I also wanted better quality pictures of my children as they are getting older and I want to record more of their childhood.
Up close pictures of metal is outstanding. I can count the pits from rust and see amazing detail when viewed on my computer. The effect on the flash is minimal. This will work great for the items I will post on ebay.
Of course my 4 yr old boy can use this be ... tter than I can out of the box. At 6 ft away I can see the dirt on his face while using the Auto mode. This is using the flash and in low light with the light behind him. Impressive. I did note some contrast when not using the flash but still superior to many other products. When using the flash I can take a picture of an unlit room and see great detail.
I would judge the lag between photos good. For the battery and size I would judge the flash recovery excellent. I&apos;ve only seen this quick of recovery from external batteries connected to professional level flash systems.
The video playback on my computer is jumpy just as Canon warns it may be. But HD videos on a Blu Ray level videos are like that anyway when played back on my computer. I will try to playback feature straight to my television later.
There are plenty of functions I have yet to use and much to learn. I do enjoy the ISO settings and have yet to program my own settings to get a great picture but the potential seems very promising.
I did note however that the case is a matte finish and less metallic than others. The store demo unit was heavily scratched. I do enjoy the finish regardless. The battery is rated for only 220 pictures per charge but so much better than 36 per roll.

     <Review>I bought a Canon Powershot 300 HS from B and H Photo a couple of weeks ago, and so far I&apos;ve been very satisfied with this compact unit. Over the years, I&apos;ve owned two other Powershot cameras, including an SD 980 IS. Comparing the 980 IS with the PS 300 , the latter camera is smaller and thinner, yet many of the buttons are bigger, making it easier to use than the older model. I also like how Canon moved the Auto/Program switch onto the back of the unit, and they&apos;ve included a one-touch recording button for video capture. The 12 MP CMOS sensor and wide angle zoom lens that stretches from 24 to 120mm are great features for any compact camera. and there&apos;s gobs of other features on the 300 HS that I will probably never use, such as slow motion video and effects for stills. I&apos;ve always be ... en a straight shooter, and any enhancement I make is usually in post production. Anything not to like? Well, I miss the touch screen of the SD 980, and I wish that the 300 HS used the same battery as the SD 980 so I can have a spare for each camera. I&apos;m also trying to get used to the continuous AF function on the 300 HS. Again, the touch screen on the SD 980 wins out because it&apos;s easier to work. Some users have complained about the rough texture of the 300 HS camera&apos;s body, but I like it because it really helps you keep a grip on the camera. Of course, it&apos;s always a good idea to use the hand strap too, due to the small size and lack of handle grip featured on EOS bodies. What about the pictures? Absolutely fantastic images, with saturated colors, sharp and well defined pictures that rival anything I&apos;ve seen from a small camera. I&apos;ve always liked Canon Powershot cameras, and this one is a winner as far as getting great shots. And I don&apos;t normally use a compact camera to shoot video, but I&apos;ve experimented a bit with the 300 HS, and I&apos;m very impressed with the quality of the HD video coming out of this tiny camera. In conclusion, I think that Canon has produced another winner with the 300HS. It&apos;s a very powerful point and shoot camera, which I&apos;ll be taking with me everywhere I go. It produces stills and videos that are far superior than any cell phone, and if you&apos;re willing to carry an extra device, you&apos;ll be rewarded with quality images that photo enthusiasts crave.

     <Review>Pros: Easy to use, pleasing on the eyes, takes EXCELLENT photos!

Cons: Only has 5xs zoom but I can&apos;t blame Canon...you can&apos;t expect a superzoom out of such a tiny lil thing!

Previously owned the Canon Elph 100 HS which was a pretty decent camera. Traded in for the 300 HS and have been more than happy with my decision..especially for $30 more!
Both cameras take the most amazing pictures in low light even when it is zoomed in to the max! When I say amazing I mean no other cameras (in its price range) I&apos;ve tried can compare! Both has great features. My favorite: Color Accent, smart shutter with smile detection, and Toy Camera.
The 300 HS is smaller, has a smaller LCD screen but records videos in 1080p and is able to zoom in while recording. The 100 cannot zoom and records ... in 720p. The 300HS is also made of higher quality materials I believe. The 100 feels like plastic. The 300 feels like sturdy metal. When I take out the battery it doesn&apos;t feel like it can easily break!
Overall the 300 HS was exactly what I wanted feature, looks, feel and price wise/ Hope that convinces you to buy the 300HS it really is a great camera and its super tiny and portable. Also, if you don&apos;t want to buy the 300HS because of the sandpaper feel....buy the RED...its smooth. Only the black ones are grainy.

     <Review>My wife and I wanted a small pocket sized camera that would allow us to leave our DSLRs at home during short trips. Our requirements were basically this: Small enough for front jeans pocket with the ability to get good shots in most situations. We just wanted to get print worthy snapshots with no extra baggage. This camera has fit the bill perfectly. For one, is is super fast (not as in aperture, as in from time to press the on button to ready to take a pic). The camera is ready to shoot within 2 seconds of pressing the on button. We have thrown every imaginable situation at this camera and it did great. As to be expected, extremely low light conditions are not that great, the one area our previous Sony point and shoot was better at. However, the focus on this camera has never onc ... e let us down, something out particular Sony became notorious for. The shooting modes are neat. Nothing you couldn&apos;t pull of in PS or Lightroom, but still fun. The 240 fps video mode is great fun, but the resolution when shooting in super slow motion isn&apos;t the greatest. HD video looks great, if that&apos;s important to you. We took this time to set the camera to full manual settings and it did great, but as it is a compact, getting to the correct settings is cumbersome without physical knobs and buttons for these settings. But that&apos;s what you have an SLR for, right? Photo quality has been great from this camera. I can&apos;t imagine any other camera this compact offering better image quality. To put it bluntly, it will not replace your DSLR, but for a camera that is much smaller than most higher end point and shoots, you can absolutely feel confident that your family vacation pics are in good hands. There are a couple of other alternatives that are a bit more appealing, but this camera strikes the right balance between size, image quality and price.

     <Review>Pros: Great picture and HD quality! Especially from the older SD940IS and SD1300/SD1400 models. Had a 940 IS last year and was very disappointed in picture quality, especially HD. New HS system from Canon works wonders!

Firm and solid metal casing. Plastic also feels pretty sturdy. Location of HDMI and USB ports in MUCH better location then 940IS. 

Rotating zoom button MUCH better then SD1300/SD1400&apos;s toggle switch

Metal tripod mount, thank you Canon!

120fps/240fps Slow motion video works well and is alot of fun! Been waiting for this for ages on a Canon camera!

Tons of picture modes

Buttons feel sturdy

720p and 1080p video!

True optical zoom in movie mode at long last!! Praise Canon!

Instant movie record button is nice instead ... of flicking through menus or a dial button to record a movie on the fly

Cons: Flash a bit weak, but thats to be expected with a camera this small, don&apos;t expect far off lighting with this guy.

Menu layout can&apos;t be changed, even colors

LCD could use a pixel increase, but thats a minor gripe, it looks very good overall and runs smooth.

No true manual mode, kinda sad, all my previous Canons had it. Owell, gain some, lose some. 

Battery has low rated capacity but I was still able to take at least a 75-100 photos plus HD video during a single day and did not have the battery warning go off, so this isn&apos;t a real problem for me, for others it might.

Optical zoom motor is audible in movie mode if the movie is recorded in a quiet environment

No included mini HDMI cable *im being picky here*

After waiting years for the &quot;just right&quot; replacement for my beloved Canon A570 IS and being really disappointed in Canons 940IS last year, Canon did almost everything right with the Elph 300 IS! Its a remarkable camera all around, especially considering what it can do in such a small size and price! I do alot varied picture and movie taking, from small macro shots of computer and RC parts to filming low angled videos of RC car races to low light exposure shots and so far, the Elph 300 has done a great job! Its so small and portable that I can slip it into my pocket and take it out quickly and easily for my needs! The black color has a nice textured and gritty feel to it which gives you a better grip of the camera vs the silver or red colors. Unless your a real picky photographer or camera guru, you&apos;d be hard pressed to find anything better in the price range for an excellent, do it all, point and shoot camera then the Elph 300 IS!

     <Review>Pros: good photos, videos

Cons: Deleting feature

This is my 3rd Canon Powershot. The best was the SD 780 which I lost. On SD870, Lens closure refused to open after 2 years but I liked that one too. Bought this SD300HS due to sale price of $150 at Best Buy. (make sure it is manf in Japan) Very tiny...I need small size to fit in parka pocket when I ski. I also do short dance lesson video clips&amp; love the separate button which you just press to record. Like video Zoom feature. Have not used any of the special scene modes yet...just the standard auto focus, which works well for my purpose. Bought extra battery Negative: difficult to instantly delete a photo (Canon took delete feature off the front of the camera) .

     <Review>Pros: Easy To Use; Fast/accurate auto-focus; Good Image Stabilization; Small / Compact

Cons: Short Battery Life

ELPH 300HS - 

Great camera for its worth. Consumer Reports neglects to include this camera in the point and shoot category for the next model 500HS has slightly better advanced features. 

For the occasional user that wants to point a camera and take a picture, this is ideal. Optical image stabilization adds to picture clarity and HD video is always a benefit to have available at your own dispense.

The rough texture on the camera although may seem unappealing, it is very helpful in gripping the camera and preventing accidental drops. 

Screen could be protected a bit better with a raised backing, preventing the camera from laying on the scr ... een when placed flat with lens up.

Would recommend to anyone looking for a point-and-shoot digital camera

     <Review>Pros: Small

Cons: Image quality

Have to give 5 stars to Bestbuy as no other can beat the price. But the camera itself made me disappointed. I had a better expectation as it is advertised for its HS system, but tuned out to be an fairy tale. The image quality is worse than my 4 year old canon sd1000. Here are my find outs,

1.Slow focus in house, made so many blur pics and very close focus.
2.too small for adults&apos;s hand, not easy to hold. --maybe good for ladies?
3. operation is complex. Hard to find the option you want.
4. bad LCD screen. 460K dots?
5. Maybe the bad lens cause the bad image quality?

Good things,
1. fashion and small
2. video quality is OK.</Review>

     <Review>Pros: Performance &amp; Quality

Cons: None

Absolute color depth, outstanding performance of &quot;Image Stabilization&quot; is unbelievable and true stable. Impressed with exceptional picture quality, battery life, and easy menus to operate. People rate different camera brands and feature based on their experience and perception. To me its best camera to learn, understand and practice all the features and definitions of DSLR. So anyone trying to jump into DSLR world and need to attend a school, this is the camera.
Low light performance is unique I&apos;ve seen on point and shoot cameras. I&apos;de say level of SLR if not bulky DSLR. Wide zoom is another goodies you&apos;ll get in this monster.
Print output is exceptional. I tried pictures taken developed at Walgreens, SamsClub and on Shutterfly ... . All looks gorgeous unto size of 11x8 with maximum 12 MP mages.

     <Review>Pros: Size, build quality, speed, ISO performance, price, features, video

Cons: Does not have optical viewfinder (This is an industry move, not just Canon)

This is an amazing little camera and the price was right. I got mine in a package deal with a 4GB 30X SD Card, extra battery and case.

I am going to start our saying that this is a great camera for a point and shoot. The 12.1-megapixel backside illuminated CMOS image sensor with a 5x optical zoom lens that provides a 35mm-equivalent range of 24-120mm, a generous wide-angle to a moderate telephoto. The auto focus is responsive and quite fast. The additional shooting modes are great, such as selective color, replace color, panorama, etc. The camera is nearly instant on, so you do not have to worry about missing specia ... l events. The optical image stabilization is right on and keeps all of your shots jitter free. Which leads me to my only complaint that I will discuss in the build.

Build:
My only complaint is not limited to Canon. The removal of an optical viewfinder from point and shoot cameras. This is not only important in framing your target, but it helps steady the shot. This is especially true of small cameras. It also helps in bright sunlight when you cannot see the LCD. Regardless, the industry is removing them

The build of the 300HS is awesome. Some have complained about the rough texture of the body, I LOVE IT. You can grip this camera and not worry about it slipping out of your hand. I looked at the SX230, another great camera, but the body was a little too slick. The ELPH300 is a nice solid camera and will fit in your hand quite nicely.

Indoor Shots: Absolutely amazing! You can read other reviews across the web and they will all tell you the same thing. The results are fabulous. It is one of the best cameras this size that has the ability of shooting great in low light settings. You will not be disappointed. Using AUTO mode in this situation will help those who want to just take pictures.

The ELPH 300 HS has a higher quality video mode:
1920 x 1080 resolution (full HD) at 24 fps, compared to 1280 x 720. It also has several really great features, includin ...

     <Review>Pros: GREAT image quality, comfortable to use, macro is sweet

Cons: wish it took AA batteries

this camera replaced an Olympus that had died on me in about 11 months of use. i had the full warranty thru bestbuy, and the gave me a full total refund, including the unused warranty.
this camera is small, easy to turn on, snap a shot, do a quick review, and turn it back off. im never worrying if it will look as good on the computer or printed, because it is. so far, im very happy with the colors matching up to real life. I am hard on cameras, and this one has kept up. I work out in the desert, middle of nowhere, and this always rides in pocket or the cup holder in the jeep. the only downside is that is has no sepia :(, and some of the more bling photo options take a few minutes ... to dig thru and find. BUT the macro option takes 2 clicks, and its ready to go, which is great when im trying to catch that bug, hornytoad or flower in an instant shot. this camera is winning me over to the canon brand. yes, its only 12 megapixels, but if you get one with more(megapixels) in something this small, you start seriously losing out on image quality (like my last camera). i put a scratch film protector on the back view screen the moment I pulled it out of the box, and i recommend everyone doing that. it has an auto and a program mode, and mine has been in program mode since day one. I also bought a second battery, because the square ones just arent as easy to recharge as a AA battery is (and are findable in gas stations when you run out of juice)

     <Review>I&apos;ve actually bought two of these little cameras. The first one I lost within three days of having it. It was such a cool camera that I chose to get another one. What&apos;s cool? The full HD video, for one thing. The image stabilization is awesome. The slow-motion feature is really fun! The images are nice and clear, too. The fisheye effect is super fun to play with, and the miniature effect puts a neat twist on images -- I haven&apos;t used it much for video since it would take a while to make it worth while. Oh, and I like that the lens is fairly wide (24mm equivalent for 35mm frame). I wish it had a time-lapse video feature like my SD1000. :-( The size is great, and the user interface is good. I kinda wanted to get the touch-screen model, but I figured it wasn&apos;t worth the extra cost ... .

     <Review>Pros: All metal, well built, made in Japan for better quality. Fits in purse easily. Auto setting for easy pic taking, many custom settings available for more experienced photographers. Reduced need for flash indoors due to a new sensor. Clear pictures with good color, good anti shake ability. Very quick start up. Nice easy to use camera.

Cons: It&apos;s auto focus decides what to focus on and may sometimes not pick the spot you want. You can change to P mode and select center focus for times when this happens. Bright flash. 

Best suited for smaller hands. Very large hands and it may be too small for you.

Canon makes the best cameras. This is another in their long line of quality products. 

Newegg has a good deal on price and a free case and sometimes a f ... ree memory card. Good site to buy from.

     <Review>Pros: Picture quality

Cons: no complaints so far

WOW!!! Just plain WOW!!! I have used the camera on Auto only so far, and the pictures are unbelievable. They are clear, sharp, with perfect colors. The LCD has not been a problem outside in sunlight. Just hold the down button for a second and the display goes to full brightness making it viewable on a bright sunny day.

The pictures look great on my computer, and even better on my 46&quot; HDTV when using the mini-HDMI cable to connect the camera to the TV. Movies taken at the full 1080 setting are unbelievably beautiful on the HDTV. I use this camera taking movies of racing dogs and cannot believe the excellent quality.

The battery so far has lasted for the full day of shooting, though I am shooting on and off, not con ... tinuous. I am using an 8GB Class 10 SD memory card and have yet to fill it up with a day of racing movies and still pictures. After 2 weeks with the camera, I am totally impressed by it and in love with it. We had previously returned the 1400 due to picture quality. This Elph 300 is heads and shoulders above the 1400 that it replaces.

     <Review>Pros: 12 megapixels, full 1080p video, mini HDMI out, zoom while recording video, flash, sound quality, sleek design

Cons: Nothing!

I had an older camera shooting at 7 megapixels non-HD and I needed something for video. So I was at the store and saw this camera. It is great for the price: 1080p, 12.1 megapixels, many many features! It comes with half full battery so I did need to charge it when I got it and does not come with a memory card (I recommend 4-8GB). But I imported the photos and videos to my computer and the quality of both are absolutely amazing, no need to get a 14+ megapixel camera. It has mini HDMI to TV (sold separately) which makes the video on my TV great quality. A feature that many cameras do not have is zooming while recording video, but this camera does ... have that!

     <Review>I currently own a 5D Mark II and was looking to replace my Canon S80 which is now 6 yrs old. While I love the S80 and the quality pics it captured, the bulkiness of this point-and-shoot (P&amp;S) became inconvenient. My wife was adamant she wanted a more compact P&amp;S this time around. In addition to great pics, I was looking for a P&amp;S with 1080p video capability so I wouldn&apos;t have to get a separate camcorder. Let me say that the 300 HS is a quality camera packed into a sleek body that I can easily slip into any pocket on the run. Most Canon cameras (I am a Canon loyalist) take great shots. But what most impresses me about this camera are its low-light capabilities. It obviously can not match the image quality of a DSLR, but for a P&amp;S, I was impressed! Indoor night shots o ... f my kids WITHOUT flash (incandescent lighting only) come out amazingly crisp with minimal noise. Autofocus is quite impressive as it tracks faces in the frame further enhancing ease of use. Menu functions are quite intuitive (if you&apos;ve owned previous Canon models). It&apos;s got plenty of preset shooting modes. And it&apos;s quick between shots for a P&amp;S (a couple seconds with flash photography). I also compared the 1080p video vs Flip Ultra HD which shoots in 720p. The video quality is like night-and-day with the 300 HS finishing ahead by a mile. Low-light video is grainy but still watchable (unwatchable on Flip). In daylight, video looks beautiful. Video is easily imported into both iphoto and imovie. I did purchase an extra battery after reading battery life can be short. I&apos;ve had the camera a week and have used it for 15-30 minutes daily (including video capture) and I have not needed to recharge yet. I&apos;d also recommend the black body as it has a textured housing that makes holding this small camera much easier. Overall, considering the excellent quality of the camera, easy portability, and great price, this camera is worth every penny.

     <Review>Pros: Perfect for video&apos;s. Easy plus smooth &amp; quiet zoom

Cons: Nothing. It does what I bought it for.

Compact and easy to use. So far, it&apos;s been rugged as I carry it in my pocket every day. You can set the program mode to do special shots and it&apos;s only a click away. Having a direct video button is a big plus as you can shoot video as quickly as taking a photo. The battery life is good enough. So far I haven&apos;t had to buy a backup. I think I got a lot for my money. Well worth having, regardless of what your experience level is, as It&apos;s nice to always have a camera handy.</Review>

     <Review>Pros: big screen, small size

Cons: interior cfl bulb shots

The camera takes great outside pictures. We have CFL bulbs in nearly all our house. When in auto mode the pictures turn out very yellow. I adjust for that by setting the white balance to a different setting and it turns out ok, still a little too yellow. I just have to remember that if i&apos;m inside, use program mode, if outside use auto. My 10 yr old canon 5mp camera didn&apos;t have this problem. outside pictures turn out great. battery life is longer than i expected. Flash seems to be in an inconvenient spot -- half of the times i cover it with one finger. Seems to be the best value for a pns right now.</Review>

     <Review>Pros: pretty color

Cons: everything

Wish I could have rented one before relying on ratings. Instructions lacking. Buttons close together causing changes in modes, distance(and no, I don&apos;t have fat fingers-I am 110 lbs and a grown adult). Camera holder is too small for camera and extra battery-had to buy a cell phone carrier to hold both. All in all, disappointed. Focus time long, zoom slow and instructions very poor!-battery does not keep charge-either of them-for more than about 100 pictures.
Need one to rent? Mine is available.</Review>

     <Review>Pros: Very fast operation, Great in low light

Cons: Reduced sound on videos while zooming

I needed something fast. This seemed to be the fastest camera in my price range at the time I bought it. It takes excellent photos in low light. The macro mode is the best I&apos;ve seen. The finish is a little bit like sand paper (black color only) and I actually like it (didn&apos;t at first). It helps the camera feel stable in my hand.

One negative is that when you zoom in and out while recording video, it lowers/ alters the sound... it&apos;s like some sort of noise reduction is being employed. I&apos;d personally rather just hear the zoom&apos;s motor myself, but there&apos;s no option I&apos;ve found that allows for this. Also, the battery doesn&apos;t last as long as the Canon SD1200 camera I had before, but it&apos;s ... still not too bad.

On the plus side, mine was made in Japan (some are made in China).

     <Review>I have purchased this camera to replace aging (but still functional) Panasonic P&amp;S that did not support HD video recording. Canon has a nice finish (silver) and it is very small. It is appealing to my wife which calls my Nikon P300 boxy. We have tested the camera inside and outside. So far the results are good but I would have to say that the Panasonic with Leica lens takes better indoor pictures. It is most likely due to the weaker flash on 300HS. As to the functions, everything is clearly marked and the amount of buttons is pretty much perfect for the small P&amp;S. I would have to mention is that be aware that the black version has different texture than the silver one. Black model has sandpaper-like texture which my wife did not like and we had to exchange the camera for a silver ... one. Also, when you press MENU on the camera there is no way to change the picture size setting. You need to press different button to change that. It wasn&apos;t very intuitive at first. For that I have deducted one star.

     <Review>I research everything to death, so when it came time to replace our aging Canon I looked at reviews on Consumer Reports and CNet. Canon rates high pretty consistently and this camera seemed to get good reviews. Great price from Best Buy, too.

We&apos;ve been very happy with it in the couple of months that we&apos;ve owned it. It&apos;s very light and small, easy to carry. If you&apos;ve had a Canon digital camera in the last 5+ years, the layout and controls will be very familiar. The pictures look great, not pixelated, and the video is pretty good too. Even the flash works well. Really, my favorite part is how quickly the picture is snapped after you push the button - we have a baby and you can capture that fleeting smile right away (the old camera seemed to take forever).

Downsides? The auto c ... olor balance seems a little off. In the same room, with the same lighting, some pictures come out looking yellow and some not. The zoom isn&apos;t the best either. It&apos;s only 5x for the regular zoom, and once you&apos;re past that into digital land it looks pretty bad. I think that&apos;s mostly standard for these small cameras though.

Overall very happy, and I would buy another one of these if the baby destroyed this one (!).

     <Review>Pros: Performance, Price, Functions, Small Size

Cons: Hard to read in sunlight, some delay between snaps

It is hard to imagine a better camera for the price. Easy to use, compact, very good optics, multi-functional. Battery life better than reviews have indicated. Good low light camera.
Only difficulty is seeing image screen in sunlight - would be nice to have a view finder, but that would introduce cost and other issues.
Would abslolutely recommend this to anyone short of a professional photographer.</Review>

     <Review>Pros: Price, photo and video quality.

Cons: Battery door feels cheap, the flash location needs getting used to.

First what I like. The photos come out great but you might not want to use auto. I find the the the pics comes out fuzzy, sometimes on the auto setting. Useing the program-portrait mode seems to work out great. The video is quality is a major up grade from my 4 year Samsung. Clean,crisp and good lighting. The lag time between shots has been at longest around 3 seconds, tops. With good lighting there is very littel or no lag time at all. The power burst mode that lets you take somethig like 5 shots in a second, something I only thought you could get with much mor pricey camera. Works great. Overall it is a great camera that takes great shots, if your in the right mod ... e. What I do not like is getting to the mode, they are all lumepd together. It will take getting used to. However, the video is just one button you press to go right to video mode. The flash is in the extreme left hand siide while shooting, so becareful where you have your fingers (I am used to the center). The battery pack door is &quot;weak&quot;, I am hopeing I do not break it with my large hands. This is a great camera , and for the money, you would have a hard time finding a better one.

     <Review>I own a T2i as well as this point and shoot. It took me a while to get used to the fact there there aren&apos;t a whole lot of options with this camera. Camera: The auto mode will allow you to choose use auto tracking and auto flash. Auto tracking will focus on whatever is in the center of the screen. Program mode will give you a little more control. Three shooting modes (macro, normal, and infinity), exposure, and four flash modes (auto, on, slow synchro, and off). Overall, the shots are decent and the shutter lag is great compared to some others that I&apos;ve used. It&apos;s around 300ms for those that like numbers. Video: There&apos;s not much to the video really. All you are given is the record button and off it goes. There&apos;s no control over anything. I recorded my son&apos;s Christmas performance in scho ... ol and a large part of the video was out of focus. It&apos;s hard to see it in the small screen but once it&apos;s on a 52 screen, all the flaws are realized. I guess I&apos;m coming from a DSLR but I want more controls. if you are looking for granular controls look else where. However, if you just want to pull it out of your camera and start shooting, this is the camera for you. The photos are great in a well lit outdoor environment and not too shabby in normal indoor lighting. I haven&apos;t done too many shooting in the dark, so I can&apos;t give you any insight there.

     <Review>Pros: The camera takes crisp pictures with vivid color and has a fast reaction time even in low light. The small size makes it easy to stick in your pocket. The HD video is amazing. Cons: The video is set to HD out of the box which can use up memory quickly if you are not careful. In HD mode the battery drains very quickly so having an extra one or two on hand is a good idea. Overall: As an advanced amateur photographer I love this camera!</Review>

     <Review>Overall I like the camera. I love the compact size. The color is not what I wanted and still not great in the low light of our house but takes great pictures outside. Still a little slow on shutter speed with my kids they move so fast but comparable to most point and shoot cameras. I have not used the video feature yet.</Review>

     <Review>I bought the Canon ELPH 300 HS to replace my lost SD 1200 IS. I originally bought the ELPH 100 IS, but there were two things I did not like about it: 1. No zoom while in video mode, and 2. The control buttons are too small I returned the 100 and bought the 300 and am very happy with my decision. Even though the LCD is a little smaller (2.7 vs. 3.0), the camera has larger controls which make it easier to access the abundant features (including a tilt-shift mode called miniature mode), and it can zoom while in video mode. There are also modes for video shooting and is shoots video in HD and stereo. It has a pretty wide angle lens, going down to 21.5 mm and can shoot in Macro mode. One of the things I really like about it is that you can set it to display a grid on the LCD. This is nice ... because it helps level your shots and aids when shooting in thirds (look it up if you are not familiar with this photographic concept). I bought this camera as a compliment to my primary camera, which is Canon 40D DSLR with a variety of lenses. The 300 HIS is great because I like having a camera that fits in my pocket and can take it anywhere I go, which I do. The photo quality is very good, as is the video quality. It seems to take a little time between shots, but it does have a high-speed burst mode for action shots. Another thing that I did notice is that when taking close-up shots with the flash on, it sometimes produces a shadow in the lower-right side of the frame. The kit includes the Canon Digital Solutions software for basic editing and downloading from the camera and USB/RCA cables for connecting to your computer and TV. I wish that the kit also included a mini HDMI cable because it has an HDMI connection. Other than that I have not complaints. It&apos;s small, easy to use, and takes great quality, 12mp photo&apos;s. I would definitely recommend this camera to anyone.

While I havnt had this quite long enough yet, it has VERY slow zoom on video! Also, it has very poor focus on low battery for some reason. It also lacks a wide angle shot and post card like my old sd800, as well as an aquarium and firewroks setting like my old sd800! It also annoyingly can not hold an LCD protector- it keeps coming off when sliding it in/out of case. It is because the LCD isnt recessed and actually sticks out a micron over the rest of the back. VERY POOR DESIGN! It also is extrememly hard to erase a picture that you had just taken as it requires like 4-5 steps! UUGH! The 24mm ultra wide angle ... is superb though and so is the compact size. Not many customizing sound settings either like my old sd800. (No dog howling when on self timer!) I think all in all for 12 mp, it has the same pic quality as my 7 mp sd800, just alot neater. I reccomend it, although they can def improve on it!

     <Review>Pros: Size, resolution, video capability, ease of use and the color is cute!

Cons: Haven&apos;t found anything yet!

I have had Sonys for years, but they don&apos;t really take good indoor pictures (outstanding for outdoors). So, I decided to find a little camera that was good all the time and not bulky at all (like my Sony). I was originally looking at a less expensive model, but after looking some more, I ended up buying this model (in Red too). I can now say that I am officially in LOVE with the camera. Is small, light, fast, it takes GREAT pictures, the resolution is awesome and is so easy to use. No matter what button I press, it takes good pictures (not like my other camera that I messed up the pics anytime I touched a different setting).
I am actually going back to the store t ... oday to purchase one for my Mom.
This camera is worth the money!

     <Review>I carry a point and shoot camera with me on my belt all the time. As the designated photographer for several organizations and groups, I need a camera available to quickly shoot things as they happen. The Powershot 300 is an excellent small camera. It is loaded with features and takes great photos. It has a large LCD and simple to operate controls. As much as I love the features, the biggest draw back for the quick candid photos I take is the length of time the camera takes to focus and shoot. Often those candid moments are missed. My other issue is its delicate construction. With the camera in a belt pouch, bumping into a chair arm put a small dent in the front lens ring. My last point and shoot from another manufacturer lasted more than four years with this kind of use. I&apos;m concerned abo ... ut the life of this light weight construction. Those issues aside, I am pleased with the camera. It has great stability in low light conditions and its auto controls take great flash photos.

     <Review>I have had the Canon Elph 300 HS camera only for a few days.
Pros:
+ backlit CMOS sensor. Works well in low light.
+ HD video
+ Ability to zoom while taking video
+ Excellent pictures for a point and shoot. I also have a Canon SLR. It does not provide SLR-quality in terms of depth-of-field, but great for the cameras of this size.
+ Small size
+ Very wide angle from 24 mm. Provides interesting photo composing opportunities compared to a camera that starts at 30 mm.
+ My daughter loved a shooting mode in which it captures a small amount of video prior to shooting a photograph to show the activity before the photo.
+ metal tripod mount
+ HDMI output
+ Program mode provides some flexibility in terms of choosing white balance and flash mode.

Cons:
- Bo ... dy appears to be a combination of metal+plastic (not sure). It seems sturdy enough, but I wish it was all metal and Canon stated that clearly.
- No aperture priority/shutter priority/manual mode.

Competitor camera with similar features to look at: sony DSC-WX9. It appears to be a toss up between the two - both appear outstanding cameras in their class. We ended up going for the Canon Elph 300 HS.

     <Review>Pros: ease of use

Cons: the strap included

Love this camera! We needed a replacement camera becuase ours was old and starting to lock up. So we purchased this new version of our old camera and absolutely love it! I read the previous reviews on here to make sure others were pleased and if any issues. The camera is perfect! Works wonderful, takes great pics, small enough to fit in pocket or small carry pouch, the texture is an easy to grip- I like that, the features are amazing! Love it! VERY PLEASED! And the battery charger came with it- yeah! We did purchase extra batteries at Amazon for a lower price and have been very pleased, we were able to buy mutli batteries for a very low price. The only thing I do not like about the camer accessories- the strap that came with it is ve ... ry stiff and always sticks in the camera shot, so I replaced it for one I had on my old camera.

     <Review>I love the very small size of this camera, and the quality of pictures it takes. It&apos;s a great point and shoot camera to just keep in my purse at all times. The video quality is good, also. I had previously owned cameras that used AA rechargeable batteries, so I was concerned with the battery life of this camera, but I have been very impressed. The battery lasts much longer than AA&apos;s. I&apos;m very pleased with the quality of the camera for the price.</Review>

     <Review>Pros: Size fits into pocket

Cons: SLight distortion at edges and pictures need color corx. They are a little on the green side.

I wanted a small camera to fit into pocket. Display is very good, and pictures are Ok. I have noticed a slight distortion on edges of lens and when I bring them over to my computer they generally need a color correction. They are on the green side of neutral.

Flash is not great.

I like the one touch button to take a movie and the fact that I can zoom in while taking it.

I own other canons and like the software.</Review>

     <Review>Pros: Video

Cons: Durability

I bought this camera in June 2011. The pictures were good, though not as great as I had hoped. They were only somewhat better than those I had taken with a Sony Cybershot purchased in 2003. The HD video, however, was excellent and quickly became a favorite feature. Unfortunately, the camera refused to open when I turned it on in September. I sent it back to Canon and they replaced it. I paid shipping. I had a new camera in a week. The camera they sent me, however, was defective. The shutter would not consistently open all the way or close completely. I needed to send it back again. They paid shipping this time, and replaced it once more. Another week without a camera. In January, I noticed a spot had developed on the lens that showed up on any pho ... to I took with telephoto. Very frustrating. I didn&apos;t address it immediately with Canon, however, having already been frustrated with my experiences with the camera. Then last week I took the camera to the park--I placed it in my front pants pocket as I&apos;ve always done, and when I took it out, the top of the camera had split open and one of the tabs that held the camera together was sticking out. I sent the camera back to Canon. They considered this damage to the camera and refused to fix it without charging me $140. Now, nine months into this camera, I&apos;m left with virtually nothing--I&apos;m not going to invest anymore money into the camera because of its durability issues. My Sony lasted eight years--the main reason I wanted to upgrade was the advances in technology. I didn&apos;t treat this camera any differently than I treated the Sony. My recommendation is to stay away from this Canon Powershot Elph 300 HS--it&apos;s a durability nightmare. Four major concerns in nine months, and now, no Canon support.

     <Review>Pros: EVERYTHING!!!!!

Cons: e-manual/guide book (no printed version included).

I&apos;m going to be honest. I&apos;ve been a little dissatisfied with Canon cameras lately (but I&apos;ll admit that part of it was my own fault in how I cared for my cameras). The part that wasn&apos;t my fault was the shutter response time. It was so slow in the point and shoot consumer-product models. HOWEVER, this model got it right! It&apos;s immediate (when using the shutter button halfway focus trick)!

I am sooooooo happy with this purchase. I tried another brand (Nikon) since I&apos;ve been disappointed with Canon, and within days of using the Nikon I absolutely hated it. I really wanted to give them a try, but they didn&apos;t even come close to the quality and vibrance that Canon always gives my images. And THIS pa ... rticular Canon model absolutely floored me! It takes the most gorgeous pictures!

The quality of the images (even in low-light situations) are impressive, and the video is amazing too!

Features: lots of them. Like &quot;high speed burst&quot; which is really high-speed burst (unlike &quot;continuous shooting&quot; in their older models), and then there&apos;s &quot;miniature effect&quot;, &quot;accent&quot; (splash of color effect), and much more. Then there&apos;s the typical things like sepia, b&amp;w, etc..., and of course &quot;scenes&quot; like beach, snow, foilage, etc!

I highly recommend this camera! Even my friend who is a professional photographer is impressed with it. She&apos;s going to buy herself one (for personal-use of course, not for professional-use).

The downsides are few:
-- 1. It might take a bit of getting used to to access the various features and settings. But the electronic manual offers much help in showing you how to access the features and sub-features. The only problem is...
-- 2) it&apos;s an e-manual so you have to lug around your laptop or e-reader to get help while your out taking pics! lol
-- 3) You&apos;ll probably get better looking shots without using &quot;auto&quot;, but that&apos;s typical of all cameras.
-- 4) Battery doesn&apos;t seem to last as long as the NB-6L, but it still has long battery-life. It lasted me about 3-4 days befor ...

     <Review>after ending up with lots of vacation shots from a smartphone camera, i decided i should invest in a decent camera to have better pictures. i&apos;m not a photographer at all (i know the &apos;rule of thirds&apos; but that&apos;s basically it); i just wanted something around $200 that was small, had a rechargeable battery, and took great pictures with little hassle. i started with reviews on cnet and immediately had my choices down to the 300hs and the sony dsc-wx9. i lamented for awhile b/w the sony and canon but ultimately decided to go with canon. even though the sony had 16mp (as opposed to 12), a carl zeiss lens, and a larger screen, i felt more comfortable going with canon since photography is all they do. i&apos;m happy with this purchase. the pictures are great and the battery lasts forever. its even abl ... e to take shots with some nice depth of field (foreground focused, background blurry) by using focus select or the portrait setting. i would definitely recommend this small, feature-packed camera to anyone looking for a simple and powerful point-and-shoot.

     <Review>Pros: Cost

I snagged this when it was $147 on line and they matched it in store. Its a great camera and takes awesome pictures, I mainly use it to upload short HD movies to youtube. It films in 1080 HD and the picture is almost like a DSLR camera. I can&apos;t believe how crisp it is for this price. The battery is also awesome, for taking pictures and short video clips you could possibly get through a whole day with one charge easily. I got the camera in black and I like the granite look and feel The camera seems sturdy though the battery hinge seems like it could be tiger. Don&apos;t hesitate to purchase this camera, it is one of the best point and shoots out there!</Review>

     <Review>I hadn`t bought a camera for several years and needed one that offered a high resolution and other useful functions. This camera is user friendly, fairly easy to figure out, and takes great images. You can edit images right on the camera itself as well as tweaking them later using the software that comes with it. You do have to buy a memory card (they don`t tell you that in the description), and it`s a good idea to buy a case for it - not a big deal. Overall, this camera is very good for the money and I have gotten great results from each shot.</Review>

     <Review>This is a Must have camera, as long as you are an amateur. Why I say this? All pro and semi-pro photographers will have it only as a back up to a DSLR. Also we never use cameras with AUTO mode (best way is to experiment manual mode, even if takes 2-3 months to learn how to set it in 30seconds for perfect picture. For an amateur all pics are great, for a pro one pic from other 50 pics is good...this is a common because you never make the perfect picture every time you press the button. At this camera use the kids and pets mode if you have to make fast pics. Also if the light is good, you can make burst photo to be sure you have one good. Never try burst in low light, does not work good and is normal. Try to get close to ISO 100, will have no noise, but also need light...the worst case, s ... et to ISO 400 in low light, but must have a very steady hand even with stabilizer on. A ISO over 400 will make grainy pics, but is normal as long as we talk about PS camera, and not DSLR. The battery is not a good choice, I would prefer standard AA bat., but if you recharge it every day before exit from house, will be OK. Also get an auto charger, will help.(spare batt will be great) The optics deliver a good image in wide mode, but you need to make a very small geometry adjustment (for amateur is ok, for semi pro will need to use any Photoshop,Photoscape or other photo editor). The zoom is only 5x optic (we will not talk about digital zoom that is only a commercial thing), but will be enough for photos. If you want bigger zoom, look for a big camera, not for pocket ones, because the lens are better. I personally use a Fuji S6500FD for big zoom, and 6MP are more than enough. As conclusion: - is a very good PS camera for amateurs, also a good backup for semi pro users. - use AUTO in good light with no heavy contrasts. In rest go to Program AE. - consider an auto charger or spare batt. - use FULL HD video only if have a FULL HD TV. In rest go with smaller res., will be enough. Comparation with NIKON and SONY from same class : Positive: - better colours than N and S. - good burst - CMOS sensor = more sensitive Negative: - Nikon faster in shutter, also ISO 80 - Sony better at handling high contrast pics (Canon is very good but not AUTO, PROGRAM AE only) Hope this helped you in decisions.

     <Review>Pros: Very small

Cons: Picture and Video quality

I really tried to love this camera; wanted to be able to rave about a Canon product. However, I must have gotten a defective version of the Elph300. I took a ton of pictures in all sorts of conditions and the results were pretty awful. As others have said, the pictures are soft and very lacking in sharp detail. Also, there are definate flaws in how the images display bright reflections (white highlights). Low light images are not bad but the colors here are also off. Seems like the quality of the lens is poor since the wide angle causes a fair amount of distortion. Regarding the video, this was also a huge disappointment. While fairly sharp, there is skipping or what may be judder when I pan the camera quickly. It is annoying e ... nough to make the video unusable. Again, maybe I got a defective version of this camera but I&apos;ll be going back to a camera with a Carl Zeiss lens. Thanks but no thanks Canon!

     <Review>Pros: Size, decent price (on sale), Easy to use.

Cons: poor photo quality in low light conditions, no internal memory, flash hit or miss, trouble focusing, black finish mater.

After a long time looking for a digital camera that would outdo the lesser MP camera on my iPhone 4. Well, I was way off with this Canon 300.
The picture quality is very poor to say the least, especially in low light conditions. The automatic flash is hit or miss even when it IS needed!
To keep it short, I will be returning this camera asap and going for the 310 which was said to be better in low light conditions, i just hope I&apos;m not as disappointed as I was with this one.
On a good note (video quality is much better than my iPhone, but you buy a digital camera for...PICTURES)</Review>

     <Review>I got this camera a couple weeks ago before my trip to California and Vegas. This was a replacement for me Coolpix S9100 and the several other cameras I&apos;ve owned over the last 2-3 years. This is by far my favorite. It&apos;s easy to get great pictures out of this camera. The size and feel of the camera is great. Canon is finally putting high speed burst and continuous shot into their mid range pocket cams which is great for me because I take pictures of a lot of sports. The hd videos look great also.

This camera does not pack a ton of features, but it has more than enough. Also, the features beyond the basics are not super easy to get to quickly (but they really don&apos;t need to be as the auto mode is very good). I&apos;ve really been through a good number of cameras and a couple have been highe ... r end cameras. This really is my favorite. I just saw that today the price is $129. THIS IS A GREAT DEAL FOR THIS CAMERA! I paid $50 more and I have no regrets.

     <Review>Pros: Compact.

Cons: over exposure of pictures.

I own three Digital ELPHs and this one I am not impress with.

Pros:
Compact and easily fits in a pocket. Fast 3 fps. and 12MP. Fast start up for instant picture taking. So far battery lasts a long time. Good average zoom, and easy access to playback mode.

Cons:
over exposure on auto. Always have to program the ISO to compensate. Not a problem if you know what to do but its a hassle sometimes. Small width prevents the camera to stay upright on uneven surfaces for timer pictures. Flash seems to dominate the picture.

Overall an average point and shoot camera, and I will still use it for everyday activities.</Review>

     <Review>Pros: Video

Cons: Lack of manual functions

I purchased this for still images, but can&apos;t stop using the video. I also have a Kodak Playsport and the Canon has much better video. Would prefer the video button to be placed in a different spot, since it is difficult to stop the video without causing camera movement. Still camera is great. Would love to be able to have just a few more manual controls such as shutter or aperture priority. Great camera for the price. Takes awesome pictures of people. It handles difficult lighting situations with ease.</Review>

     <Review>This is great for just keeping in your pocket or backpack, it&apos;s way small, but delivers great pictures. When zoomed out it&apos;s surprisingly wide, but it doesn&apos;t zoom in as much as I would like. The black version I have has an awesome sand-paper like texture that makes it easy to hold and handle. The case is all metal, which is good cause I&apos;m usually pretty tough on my equipment. It does lack real manual controls. Has some pre-set stuff, which is ok I guess. But for just full auto point and shoot it&apos;s great. I&apos;m also really pleased with the video function, makes great HD video. For the money, it was a great buy.</Review>

     <Review>I bought this unit to replace a Casio point/shoot that I had for several years. I wanted a smaller body and faster start-up and larger screen, and at the same time, retain all the great functions of the old Casio. I shopped for a long time. This Canon is everything I wanted and more. I would highly recommend it. The picture quality is wonderful. (I only shoot large images.) But, as a somewhat pro-photographer, I thought I would really like the ultra-wide angle lens (24mm). But I don&apos;t. I find that I like to start composing a shot with a more reasonable 28mm. 99% of the users of this camera will never know. (Why not start with 24 and zoom into 28? Well, that diverts my concentration away from composing, and adds a little extra time to the task.) Now, for indoor shots, 24mm is not a bad sta ... rting point, but it&apos;s just a personal thing with me that I like 28mm. Plus,on some pics you will experience some optical distortion at 24mm. And the only other con would be the placement of the flash. It&apos;s very easy to cover the flash with your finger, something that has to be learned, but I normally use available light anyway. I don&apos;t shoot much video but the one-button for it is very nice. Would I buy it again? you bet - but with a 28mm lens, I think the model 200 has it.

     <Review>Bought this camera for my parents, who aren&apos;t too tech savvy. They can keep the camera on Auto mode and photos are great. Having a dedicated button for video is also great because my parents would get confused with having to go through the menu system, and you could lose precious seconds of video. The sand-paper like grip is great. It stays put in a simple camera sleeve-type case, although I could see the interior of the case possibly wearing over time. I wish the manual would state what memory card speeds the camera can support. Since I didn&apos;t know how fast it could support, I got a Class 10, 200x memory card which is capable of up to 30MB/sec transfer. It seems very fast. Doesn&apos;t come with a book manual, just one on a CD (which I haven&apos;t viewed yet). The camera has been that int ... uitive for me where I could perform most functions without looking up the manual. The only function I may have to look up is the multi-shot function where it&apos;ll take consecutive shots very quickly. Overall, I think this is the best small point and shoot available below $200.

     <Review>We&apos;ve used several Canon point-n-shoot cameras over the last several years and they continue to impress. What we weren&apos;t expecting with this one was some of the more fun shooting modes, like super slow-motion video and high-speed burst. Our kids do a lot of sports activities, and we&apos;ve had too much fun playing with these. Think cannonballs in the swimming pool in super-slo mo ;-) We used the high-speed burst for the last triathlon the kids did, showing them crossing the finish line one frame at a time - very cool. Pictures are crisp, auto-focus is fast and accurate, the camera itself feels sturdy even in such a small package. Would definitely recommend.</Review>

     <Review>I bought this camera to replace my Casio Exilim (not sure which model) but I&apos;ve owned three of them. I didn&apos;t like my latest model Exilim as much as the other two (it always seemed to be a lemon and finally broke) and decided this ELPH camera received so many accolades I would automatically love it! Unfortunately this was not so. The first day I started playing with the camera, I noticed a very slow shutter lag. I have a 17 month old and I was missing every action shot (this never happened with my Exilim). I contacted B&amp;H Support via chat and they were wonderful at helping me understand which settings may decrease my shutter lag. Turns out shutting off the red-eye and flash did the trick. (I must say the pic without flash does come out very nice compared to no flash on my Exilim ... .) However, I find it extremely inconvenient, especially at spontaneous moments to find the right adjustment for that particular shot. For a small P&amp;S camera, I want it to be fast and easy. This camera just didn&apos;t meet those requirements. I thought the quality of the photos may compensate for this frustration, but upon downloading my pics, I can&apos;t even notice the difference. I am a recreational/novice user, so maybe I just can&apos;t appreciate the features this camera offers? I gave it one week to see if I&apos;d get used to the features, and I&apos;m now trading it in for another Exilim. I tried to love you ELPH! Oh, the last straw was when the battery charge died...I never received any notifications or alerts...it just stopped after a day or two of use. I used to barely charge my Exilim, so I was pretty shocked at the battery life.

     <Review>First of all, I want to say that I bought this camera the day after I had bought AND returned the Sony cybershot dsc-wx9. I am %100 more satisfied with the canon than I was with the sony. DON&apos;T buy the sony!! lol I use this camera to take pictures of my kids indoors/outdoors, scenery, travel, family photos. I am VERY happy with this little thing. I kinda like the rough texture; makes it easier to grip. Great in low light and the flash isn&apos;t overpowering when used (but I hardly use the flash.) The color is the best thing IMO. Very accurate colors and you can adjust the color settings to several preset options ranging from neutral to vivid (and some other funky, cool effects.) The image stabilizer is awesome. White balance is pretty accurate, too. All around, this camera is AWESOME!! I gues ... s if I must complain about something, it would be it doesn&apos;t have an option for Tv. I wish I could make the shutter speed faster to catch my active toddler without having to use the flash. But I guess I&apos;d have to get a DSLR for that :) ALSO: I don&apos;t use this camera for video so the battery is actually pretty good for just pictures

     <ReviewTitle>Great Video + Wide Angle for the Price</ReviewTitle>

     <Review>To summarize: - HD video quality very good for the price; you need to spend $500 more to get better video quality - The wide angle is AWESOME. I underestimated how great this was when I bought it. - Photo quality was good, but not as sharp as I would have hoped. This camera is extremely versatile. I know of no other camera with such good quality in this small size. Where else can you get a HD video camera with wide angle lens that fits in your pocket? That said, you do get what you pay for. I found myself using the video function more than than the camera function, simply because I was somewhat disappointed in the camera function. Once I downloaded the photos they seemed rather flat and not as sharp as I would have expected from Canon. I had used a previous generation of an S3 abo ... ut 4 years ago and expected this camera to perform as well as that; it didn&apos;t. Bottom line: Don&apos;t expect amazing photographs from this camera, but if you&apos;re looking for a tiny pocket camera for great videos and functionality this is a good one. Final note: If using for video I highly recommend using a small Joby Gorillapod (tripod), it helped me greatly.

     <Review>Pros: Features, Small,Portable,

Cons: the delete inbox is a bit hard to figure out at first.

First of all this is my first point and shoot camera, and though I&apos;m more of a DSLR man but all I have to say about this camera is WOW.

First of all I&apos;ve never had any problems with Canon&apos;s simple and easy to use button layout. If you&apos;re one of those people that like a fast and easy camera to use get this camera.

The Features on this camera is simple and amazing. There&apos;s the auto shot and program shot. The program shot comes with all the effects like the tilt shift,toy camera, etc. Absolute fun camera to use.

The picture quality is pretty nice. There&apos;s nothing wrong with it. It&apos;s a point a shoot camera and not a DSLR so... why really bother for the quality. It&apos;s t ... he amazing moments that you want on this camera if you&apos;re main camera is not on you.

The value price for this camera isn&apos;t bad. I say its well worth the money. Also the reason why the black is slightly pricey is because the material of the camera feels solid. It&apos;s not smooth like most camera surfaces but has a rough kind of feel to it..sort of like very fine sandpaper. Though it doesn&apos;t feel its going to slip out of your hand, it just feels right and you know its in your hands.

     <Review>Wanted a small Camera that took decent quality pictures, and after much research, I chose the Canon Elph 300 HS. Very happy with my purchase. Even though I have big hands, this Camera doesn&apos;t feel that small in my hands, and the texture coating gives it a really nice feel. Takes nice pictures, the 5X Optical Zoom is amazing for a Camera this small, and I really like the dedicated movie button. I wish it had a larger LCD Screen and an Optical Viewfinder for those really Sunny days, but other than that, for the money, this is a very nice Camera.</Review>

     <Review>While I like a camera with interchangeable lens capabilities, the smaller camera is always the one I end us taking around and using because I can put it in my pocket. I love the small size of this camera and the wide angle lens feature. I has a lot of features and settings for a small camera and the small plug in battery charger is very convenient. It is the third Elph I&apos;ve owned and I loved them all. This one will probably be my favorite. It is a little slow setting up between pictures but I can live with that. I also miss a viewfinder because it isn&apos;t always easy to see the display in bright sunlight.</Review>

     <Review>Pros: Small and simple to use. Auto and preset modes work fairly well.

If you want to take slightly better pictures you can change most of the settings manually, but the menus can take a while to navigate.

Video recording quality is satisfactory.

Cons: Makes an annoying high pitched noise.

The audio recording quality isn&apos;t great, but that shouldn&apos;t be a surprise for a point and shoot camera.

Lots of unnecessary features, like color swap, but they&apos;re easy to ignore.</Review>

     <Review>Pros: Picture quality, camera body quality strong feel, NIGHT shots and movie ability, controls

Cons: Honestly nothing noted so far after 1 week vacation constant use.

Bought this camera as a replacement for Canon SD850 I have been using for several years. The 850 still performing great and now in hands of good friends, just wanted to treat myself to a new one.

Was hesitant to make purchase of a relatively new product without reviews at the time. I have come to rely heavily on these reviews and was concerned. I also worried that as a guy who is 6&apos;2&quot; and 213 lbs that camera would be way to small to handle as much thinner and smaller than already small 850. Turned out that this camera feels more comfortable in hand because of the slightly rough surface. I found this to b ... e a plus over smooth surface since I feel I have a decent grip for a change. Of course I always still use wrist strap at all times just in case. One would be remiss not doing so with the small camera&apos;s of today.

The steel body also makes me feel confidant handling the camera body. Though small camera simply has feel of a solid well made piece of equipment. I am very happy and comfortable handling and even putting it in pants pocket uncased, though I do usually use a small case.

Pictures, most digital take good to great outdoor photo&apos;s, it is indoor and night that they really don&apos;t usually standup to the old film cameras. Well I haven&apos;t taken a lot of indoor low light yet but I did take NIGHT HANDHELD mode shots from a moving platform including movies. his on recent cruise coming back into Port Everglades Florida. Normal all I have ever gotten is a blurry mass of light. AMAZING I have night pictures and movies, and decent ones! I am so impressed I did a quick youtube presentation of some shots and movies, just 2 and a half minutes worth a peek. Remember even looking good there they lose some making movie to upload. On my screens WOW! Yes I rested camera on balcony rail most time but remember this is nighttime moving ship and some of objects are moving as well.

Battery life is also extremely good just as it was with the 8 ...

     <Review>A standard point-and-shoot that is easy to use, with fast and accurate auto-focus. A big pro - the one click movie recording making it easy to record movies without struggling through various menu options. I did have some issues with Image Stabilization, especially in low lighting.</Review>

     <Review>After much research I decided to go with this little Canon point and shoot to take along on our motorcycle vacation to the Four Corners region. I must say that it has been more than adequate for the task. It fits easily into the tightest of pockets and takes up very little room, a most important consideration when traveling by motorcycle. I have been keeping it in one of the little tank pouches that Harley makes to replace the stock bib on most of their softail models. You can put it in a small padded case and it fits in there perfectly???comes out quickly too. Something else I have found is that this little camera really fires up in a hurry. Push the on/off button and you are ready to take photos in way under two seconds???incredible! And the extra wide angle of the 24mm (35mm equivalent ... ) zoom lets you really get it all in while shooting those fantastic vistas you see out West. The super simple Auto mode lets you start taking photos in seconds. Even the most incredibly uneducated will be zooming and snapping first class photos in minutes. And I do mean first class. The photos this little camera takes are truly some of the sharpest and clearest I have seen from any point and shoot. Though the pictures are not the same quality as a high end DSLR, they are really much more than I ever expected. The only complaint I have is that the rather small view screen is difficult to see in bright sunlight. I would venture to say that this is true of all but the most expensive point and shoot cameras. In conclusion all I can say is I&apos;m going to keep this little gem of a camera and I feel like I got more than my moneys worth from this one.

This is quick to turn on, and the image stabalization is fantastic. The battery life is outstanding and you can recharge it instead of going through a ton of AA batteries like most other cameras. The features are strong and the picture and video quality is great. Fantastic product for the price.</Review>

     <Review>Pros: Size, Price

Cons: Video Zoom Recording

I purchased this camera because of its compact size. I can put it in my pants pocket with no problem. It&apos;s very portable. It takes pretty good pictures. Video quality is good. The only thing I don&apos;t like is that the sound cuts out somewhat while zooming in and out. It&apos;s able to take pictures in low light, but many of them come out blurry. The burst mode allows you to take rapid shots, and I like how they are lumped together in playback mode.</Review>

I&apos;ve had several different P&amp;S cameras over the years and Canon have always been the best. The picture quality is the best you&apos;ll find in a non-DSLR camera. It&apos;s ultra compact and easy to use. The new video record button is extra handy.</Review>

     <Review>Pros: Small size, great video, better than average pictures

Cons: pictures are slow compared to SLR cameras, better than some point-n-shoot

I would definitely buy this camera again. I did not believe that I wanted a camera this small. I was wrong. Great to carry in your pocket and have available whenever you need. Better than average pictures. Full 1080 HD video -- looks great on TV direct from the camera. Only complaints are minor -- pictures are a bit soft in low light and camera takes some time to auto focus and shoot. These minor complaints are more than made up by the excellent video quality.</Review>

     <Review>Pros: Picture Quality

Cons: Not enough features

I bought this camera to replace my 8-yr old Z700 Kodak Easyshare that finally went out on me. W/ my $10-rewards certificate, I got this(case, 4G SD card + $15-gift card) bundle taxes and all for $132-ish. The biggest complaint I have is that the video quality in low light to dark setting, is very poor. (Audio wasn&apos;t all that great either.)The pictures however, were great even in a very dark room,esp. for someone known to be the worst &quot;picture taker ever&quot;. I recorded my son&apos;s event where the entire room was pretty much just candle-lit and I could barely see anything when I played it back. So, I don&apos;t know if there is a &quot;lighting option&quot; for recording vids in low light or what, but I obviously didn&apos;t find or figure it out. Another ... thing is, it doesn&apos;t have as many &quot;fun&quot; picture editing tools as my old Kodak, ie, cartoon, fisheye, drawing, etc....But I can live with that. Nice sleek design, easy enough to use, great pics and unbeatable price!

     <Review>Pros: very slim

Cons: Only when taking picture and videos. The flash worked nice at least

I purchased this camera at BestBuy last week for $129(brand new) but the pic quality were so bad that when I compared them with to my old Casio 5Meg Pix that is 6yrs old they look unacceptable.
The colors, the sharpness and the focus were below acceptable.
Videos were horrible and when I play them, on any of my home computers the screen kept showing every 2 seconds a bunch of horrible, staticky lines across the length of all the videos screen.
I formatted the memory card hoping that this could be the issue but the problem came back the next day.
I returned it back to BestBuy and I got my money with no hassle after going through so much BS with this Canon ELPH 300 HS.
It is ... the worst junk made by any Camera manufacturer and it was NEW.
I always hear about the good quality with Canon cameras but I had 3 of them and 2 of them gave me nothing but problems(Btw my old Casio 5.0 Megs that is 6 yrs old, keeps on going strong.
Shame on these people, I&apos;ll never get another Canon. Ever!!!

This is a great camera. It&apos;s small &amp; light. Took it on vacation &amp; everyone thought my pictures looked amazing. Love the fact that the battery is rechargeable &amp; I don&apos;t have to run out and buy AA batteries. It is annoying that the memory card isn&apos;t included but thankfully they&apos;re not expensive.</Review>

     <Review>Pros: Everything

Cons: Slow motion is not as clear if you are not up close

I LOVE this little camera. It fits in my small purse, takes great photos and has great features. This camera replaced my Canon Point and Shoot 1400SD and that was already a good camera.

There is a new feature called slow motion that records video in...you guessed it; slow motion. It also has a burst mode to take a ton of pictures at once. The Toy picture feature is cute too. I am a photographer and have a Canon EOS 60D, but don&apos;t always want to carry it everywhere I go, so to not miss out, I carry this one everywhere and haven&apos;t disappointed yet.</Review>

     <Review>Pros: Everything, Small, Price, Easy to Use

Cons: Slow Auto Focus and Could have a Longer Battery Life

I bought this camera to upgrade from my old Canon Power Shot A630. I needed something that was smaller and took high def pics and vids. This one was it. I watched YouTube video reviews on it before i bought it. Everyone had nothing but good stuff to say about it. Its easy to use and functions very well. The video is in 1080p. as well as the pictures it takes are high def as well. Its a great camera. I love it.

Only down side is, the auto focus is slow. So depending on how fare you are looking and then quickly switch to up close or want to look at something really up close, it can take like 3 to 4 seconds before it focuses in. But who cares. Its not really that bad, an ... d for the cheap price and all the Amazing features you get, I think you just like me can deal with that. Can&apos;t win them all.

Its a great camera and if you buy this camera You will be very proud and not disappointed. It could even make great gift for some one. You wont be disappointed.

     <Review>Great little pocket camera from Canon. I&apos;ve been very pleased with the performance of this camera. It&apos;s got a decent size sensor, picture quality is quite good, zoom is reasonable, and it&apos;s got a really nice rear display. It&apos;s important to recognize what this isn&apos;t. You will not get DSLR (or even G1X/G12) performance from a camera like this. The flash is okay, there is a bit of shutter lag, battery life is okay, etc. It&apos;s a pocket camera. For me though, the synergy of small size, simplicity and great picture quality makes this an easy choice for anyone wanting to have a camera with them at all times that exceeds the capabilities of a smartphone camera.</Review>

     <Review>Pros: small, good image quality

Cons: purple fringing in high contrast areas

This camera has an awesome high-speed-slow motion feature hidden in the settings. The image quality is awesome - with the exception of pretty heave purple fringing in high contrast areas. Of course, it is a small sensor camera, this is to be expected. The camera is so light and small that I carry it with me all the time, so no shot is missed. These small cameras have come a long way. Short of getting a real camera like a DSLR or Rangefinder, this is probably as good as it gets. Careful with the lens cover. It looks a little fragile. No problems so far.</Review>

     <Review>Pros: Size, ease of use.

Cons: Zoomed pix

My zoomed distance shots are blurry, out of focus. There is also a delay between shots. Pictures do not have the clarity I would expect from this caliber of camera. It was worth the sale price that included SD card and case.</Review>

     <Review>Once upon a time I traveled the world with a Canon SD1000. It was a wonderful little cam that finally got taken from me at an event where I was performing (who robs the DJ? WTH?).Nevertheless, I took the plunge on the SD1400 and was VEry disappointed. Grainy in low light, horrible pics and quality (that cold digital look), weak warm up time, and SLOW when taking that perfect shot. The 300 came out not too long ago and its killer. Only [$], great in low light, decent burst (though you have to settle for 3MP shots), beautiful video quality, 24mm lens, stereo sound, and FAST on the trigger. Thanks to this bad boy I don&apos;t miss shots I want to get when out with friends. My SD1400 bit it from all the agressive travel to South America and desert festivals, etc. Finally the screen cracked ... among many problems. To be fair, I put it thru heck, even sleeping on it while it lay in my pockets while I trekked the Andes. Still, I was never happy with it.This camera has been wonderful so far. It will soon get some small tests as I take it to Europe. Let&apos;s hope it holds up like my SD1000 did!

     <Review>I had a Powershot 780 IS from a few years ago and this camera (Powershot 300 HS) takes clearly better pictures, even though the pixel count is the same and the zoom range and lens size are similar. Focusing is also noticeably faster, though still much slower than a DSLR. Colors are more vibrant and the images are much sharper. Settings like toy camera and miniature are fun. The auto setting is a bit quirky and unpredictable in terms of speed/aperture choices as well as flash on/off choice and autofocus, but that is pretty much par for the course on pocket cameras such as this. I think Canon is still the leader in the point-and-shoot market and I am very happy with this as a back-up/snapshot camera.</Review>

     <Review>This is a fantastic camera... Very small and loaded with features! Takes great HD video, and wonderful pictures. Extremely small. Exact size size as a credit card (tall and wide), and about as thick as 13 to 14 of them stacked (yes, I made a stack of credit cards and compared it to the camera). Only thing is that low-light pictures are a little grainy. Also, it has an auto-sensing flash that does not always turn on in low-light situations. I cannot find a way to force the flash to work like with most cameras, which is frusterating. If I could manually control of the flash I would have given this 5 stars.</Review>

     <Review>Pros: Small / Compact; Black textured surface; Easy Closeup Mode; Easy Auto Modes; Easy To Use; Great video

Cons: Weak Flash; Lag / Shutter Delay

I bought this camera for my wife but I use it more than she does. I bought it an easy to carry camera as I normally use a Canon 7d and 60d so I wasn&apos;t going to buy a larger P&amp;S camera.
Now I find it&apos;s my &apos;go to&apos; camera for HD video as it&apos;s so easy. dSLRs shoot great video but they&apos;re not that easy to use as they don&apos;t autofocus and have limited depth of field. I also use it for macro shots as P&amp;S cameras have that capability built-in and this one automatically can go into the mode.
I would have purchased the red version but it doesn&apos;t have the texture that the black one does and is harder to grip (I have big hands). Ev ... eryone should use the wrist strap anyway!
The flash is a little weak and &apos;shot to shot&apos; delay can be frustrating but in general it&apos;s a fun little camera (remember, I&apos;m used to dSLR cameras!)
The included video is shot with both the little 300HS and my 7d- a little hard to tell the difference!

     <Review>I wanted a camera that was small to throw in my purse but did a lot of the functions of my bigger camera... this does it. I have the Canon SX30IS for sight-seeing and big events. The Powershot 300 does a lot of the same things my bigger camera does. The primary difference: less optical zoom. But, the two menus are pretty much the same with just minor differences. And, it has a majority of the same shooting options in terms of color, light, scenes, etc. It makes switching from one camera to the next a breeze. Shots are very clear and camera is lightweight and easy to use. Perfect for those impromptu events with friends and family.</Review>

     <Review>Pros: Easy To Use; Good Image Quality; Small / Compact

This is a great snapshot camera. Like all cameras in its class it works best outdoors or any situation with lots of light. Canon&apos;s point and shoot line are great and have good image quality compared to other P&amp;S cameras. it is not a DSLR by any means, but I would recommend this to anyone who wants to have a decent camera around for family shots. macro feature is nice too.</Review>

Amazing video quality on such a small camera. On video playback however, if there was zooming in or out while recording, you can hear it and is a little annoying.</Review>

     <Review>Pros: great quality at a great price

Cons: depending on how you hold the camera you make have a shadow at the bottom from your finger

This is my 3rd &quot;point and Shoot&quot; camera In a span of 7 years. I wanted to upgrade my sanyo because it no longer worked when I really needed it to work. So I researched a while and was looking for a camera that would do a good job at shooting videos. I am a novice youtube video maker and I wanted something that would take nice quality pictures as well as videos. The sound pics up nice and the pictures look amazing.
I also enjoy the the features on this camera. There are so many different features such as slow motion videos down to focus and making some parts blurry. So anywho I do not know the photography terms just yet but I have really been ... enjoying this camera. I picked up back in Nov. and I use it about 1-2 times a week. Battery works really well!!

     <Review>Pros: Great video and images, very easy to use, a video camera in your pocket

I was sick of lugging around my SLR and wanted something that would be less of a burden, but would still take great pictures. This camera fit the bill...and then some. It takes lovely pictures, even indoors, with the added bonus of HD video. Now I get video that I never would have captured before for family memories. Its also very easy to use, with clear and simple controls. I even bought one for my dad, who is 88, and he is also loving it. He kept in in his shirt pocket on a recent trip and used it all the time. One small detail, I found the edge of the lens cover a bit sharp on the red model I first received, and so exchanged it for a black one.</Review>

     <Review>I bought this camera for my girlfriend who is not a tech-head at all. I wanted something very small (like my aged Canon SD 200) that would take great pictures in automatic mode, and would be easy to access other features. The output of this camera is amazing. It&apos;s very small to carry around and is a breeze to use, especially when traveling and one doesn&apos;t want to be encumbered by a bulky camera and lenses. Battery life is much better than my old SD 200. This product surpasses all my expectations, and I highly recommend it.</Review>

     <Review>I bought this because my Canon IXUS 800 IS started to die. (This model IXUS is the European model equivalent to the PowerShot SD700 IS and it was spectacular but picture quality and battery time started to go downhill fast after the lens would no longer close all the way after retracting??? this is apparently a common issue with canon&apos;s but I still like the brand). I like that the 300 HS camera is small and light, uses the same battery as my IXUS does (you can&apos;t beat the convenience of already having an extra battery). I think it is snazzy that the &apos;zoom&apos; feature works while recording video. So far, I&apos;ve had a few blurry shots, but many excellent pictures. I like that when in &apos;auto&apos; mode, the camera truly adjusts automatically changing to different modes when detecting the lighting and di ... stance conditions of your target, but this is a double-edged sword. The auto detection doesn&apos;t always pick the best mode resulting in some blurry pictures and missed opportunities for capturing the moment. I&apos;ll need to play around with the 300 HS a bit more so that I become more comfortable and efficient at changing modes to get the best shot. Overall I&apos;m quite happy with this camera and feel it is superior to the other cameras in this price range, but I&apos;d be lying if I didn&apos;t say I still miss how great my IXUS 800 IS was in its heyday.

     <Review>I initially wanted S95, then S100, but for my intended use, I could not justify the cost. I also looked at 510 HS, 310 HS, SX 230 and 100 HS as well as Nikon P300, S9100, and S8200. I wanted something that I can set on auto and get great pictures, no matter who presses the shutter. Pros: posh, well-built with metal clad parts; has newer CMOS sensor supposedly better in low light; wide angle starts at very useful 24mm, not 28mm like above-mentioned units; excellent 1080HD video recording with zoom capability during recording; fast start up and minimal lag between shutters (for a P&amp;S); excellent overall photo images with useful low light results; very small body but with manageable buttons; PRICE!! Cons: low-resolution LCD screen compared to competition, and not much else. 100 HS i ... s also very good if you don&apos;t mind not being able to zoom during video recording - save $30-40 over 300 HS and zoom starts at 28mm, otherwise same great images.

     <Review>Pros: Easy to use.

Cons: Nothing.

Santa delivered as promised. Takes great pictures, instructions are easy to understand. I had the camera up and running for Christmas in less than 10 minutes. Camera came with all kinds of extras, case, extra battery, 4 GB Scandisk.

Made a Christmas video on this camera and burned it on a disk at the end of the day, easy to carry in your pocket or case attached to your belt.

Passed the camera around to let others take pictures of what they liked, great looking pictures, not one bad photo in the batch.</Review>

Easy to use small and compact. Great video capabilities with the wide angle lens. For the money you can&apos;t go wrong with this camera. No,it&apos;s not a pro camera with all the whistles and bells, it is that little fun camera you put on your pocket and go. For the most part I leave the camera on auto and let it do its job and it works, of course you have to understand the basics of lighting and composition. Don&apos;t expect the camera to do miracles for you. Enjoy it and have fun</Review>

     <Review>I just bought this camera 2 weeks ago, and have been taking constant pictures with it ever since I got it! I love this camera. It has a vast array of features, which are easy to get to in the function menu, and is very user friendly. I really enjoy the 24mm wide angle lense, as it gives more depth and life to pictures. I&apos;ve owned alot of Canon Elph Powershot cameras over the years, and in my opinion, this is the best one, overall, that I&apos;ve owned. I am very satisfied with this camera, and would definately recommend it to a friend.</Review>

     <ReviewTitle>Powershot 300 HS Great for Digi-scoping</ReviewTitle>

     <Review>I use this for two purposes: 1) For digi-scoping and digi-binning wildlife, with an emphasis on birds. It serves this function very well without the need for an adapter. 2) Macro shots of insects and vegetation. I have used (and continue to use) it for the first function with several different brands of telescope and binocular including Swarowski (scopes, older and newer models), Leica (binoculars and scopes), Vortex (scopes), Nikon (binoculars, multiple models), and older Bushnell Spacemaster Scopes. It has a reasonably fast and accurate auto-focus when using it this way, and the multiple-shot drive is fast (noticeably faster than some previous Powershot models that I&apos;ve used). The video is EXCELLENT, and may be the best facet of this camera. In good light, it is also a very good cam ... era for Macro shots, but if you&apos;re forced to use the flash because of a low light situation you will be sacrificing some image quality if you&apos;re trying to photograph things within about a foot. Beyond one foot it&apos;s okay and doesn&apos;t lead to any noticeable image degradation. The autofocus can also have a tough time grabbing onto smaller objects within the field of view, especially small insects against variable-depth backgrounds. When this happens you can remedy this by pre-focusing on something solid at the desired distance (i.e. the back of your hand, or a wall), and then taking the photo of your desired subject. Overall it is a fantastic multi-use camera for these purposes (ESPECIALLY the video and in concert with high-power optics), and of course does just fine with people photos (as always, given enough light). Of course the Canon interface is very user-friendly, and the taking of video is now even easier if you need to video quickly because you don&apos;t have to switch modes. You can video by just pressing record at any time.

     <Review>I am a semi-professional photographer. I bought this camera as the camera that is always with me. To that end it is good. It is a very small camera and has features that are important such as wide angle view, fairly good in low light and is HD video capable. The still image quality is good but not any where&apos;s near as good as my Canon 60D (nor was I expecting that). That said I guess I hoped it would be a little bit better. The HD video is very good. Better than I expected. Just don&apos;t zoom in and out and expect the focus system to catch up. Once you plan your shots this is not a problem because you can cut the out of focus parts easily. Over all compared to my now retired SD800IS it is a much better camera.</Review>

     <Review>It&apos;s a tiny little black box with a rough exterior (literally) and a powerful interior. If you&apos;re looking for a good camera that you want to have with you at all times, this is the one. It&apos;s ultra-compact design makes it impossible to have any excuse for not always having it within arm&apos;s reach. When you grab this thing, you know that it&apos;s not going anywhere and if it does take a spill, it can handle it. So, about the quality of the photos. Having used nothing but a DSLR for the past 3 years, my judgement of ANY point-and-shoot camera is a bit skewed. But when I put my mind back to the time of my last point-and-shoot, I can appreciate the quality of this camera&apos;s output. Images are sharp and true to their color reproduction of their subjects. Another pleasant surprise was the file s ... ize of the images. On the average, they&apos;re about 2MB which I think is pretty amazing considering their resolution is 4000x3000. Additionally, the high-speed video capture that plays back in super slow motion is a VERY interesting feature that many point and shoots are featuring, but is great to have in this little powerhouse. In summary, if you&apos;re looking for a compact, durable, stylish camera that captures high-quality images, I think you&apos;re going to be more than satisfied with this choice.

     <Review>Comparable in size to a cell phone, this camera is easy to have with you wherever and whenever. Photos have good contrast and color, works well in well-to medium lit interiors and full to shaded outdoors. I have not yet tried it in true low light. While the intelligent focus system seemed to work pretty well, I was able to figure out how change the default to spot focus mode, which is what I prefer. Both methods seemed to give a nice sharp focus. I cannot speak about the flash, I turned it off immediately and have never used it. The focus assist light is very bright, enough to be plainly visible even in well-lit rooms. While it is not a super SLR or my large-format sheet-film camera, it does a very good job at everything it is supposed to do that I have had a chance to try.</Review>

     <Review>Pros: Great manual settings

Cons: Battery life is decent but not outstanding

This is an amazing point and shoot camera. I have always been a Canon user and recently upgraded my little point and shoot camera. There is a learning curve for the manual settings but once you get a hold of the features, the variety of pictures you can take is unlimited. If you are not extremely steady with your hands on some of these manual settings, however, beware that your pics will be blurry. Overall this was a perfect buy at a great price point. Once again, Canon did not disappoint!</Review>

     <Review>I debated on forking over the money to get a G12 but my husband was against it since i have broken my past 2 sony cameras. I went to BB knowing I wanted one similar to the SD1400 and was told this was the best choice. Only had it a week and have used it mostly for pictures of my fast moving 1 year old and also for HD video. VERY pleased with the low light setting and also the kids/pets feature! It is so small and easy to have in my purse at all times to capture my daughters milestones!</Review>

     <Review>I bought this camera for wife who needed 24mm wide point &amp; shoot. Disappointed in overexposed full auto---set Program mode for her instead. Long-lasting battery life, useful zoom. Video and audio very good and slow motion feature makes camera worth the price of admission. It&apos;s amazing to see the complex movement of birds taking flight with every frame a photograph. Location of flash too easy to cover with finger--takes getting used to. Even in Program Mode, you can only choose one feature at a time. The big negative ? CANON DOESN&apos;T PROVIDE A HARDCOPY INSTRUCTION MANUAL !! You have to look at PDF instructions from included disc, call Canon and wait for 3-weeks for them to send a manual in 8-1/2x11 pages or print all 214 pages yourself. Canon explained that they&apos;re a green comp ... any and shifting the hardcopy burden to the buyer. What&apos;s next? Bringing a shopping bag so retailer can hand you the camera kit in pieces?

     <Review>This camera is a great back up to my DSLR when I don&apos;t feel like lugging it around. Great for taking family snap shots just about anywhere. Easy to carry, takes great pictures and the HD video is also outstanding for a camera of this size. I will bring this on my trip to Disney so I can leave the bulky DSLR in the hotel room for a day or two and enjoy the parks!! I&apos;ll still be able to take great photos while walking around and going on the attractions as this camera fits easily into a shirt pocket. It does not replace a DSLR in any way shape or form! It&apos;s just simply a great little back up camera for when the DSLR is just a bit too much. I really have no complaints about this camera as it does everything that I expected from an incredibly small point &amp; shoot camera. I find this camera ... to be very useful in many places.

     <Review>Pros: easy to use, compact, quick, inexpensive, nice pictures

Cons: needs a little less color saturation in Auto mode

This camera is very easy to use. Sandpaper-feel is excellent for handling. Starts quick, shoots in low light, and the pictures are very crisp. Image stabilization works well. Battery life is better than expected. We haven&apos;t tried to use it in Program mode yet, but automatic point-and-shoot is good. Takes much better pictures than the more expensive Sony we replaced. My only complaint is that the pictures seem to be a little too saturated as far as color is concerned, but nothing a little Photoshop can&apos;t handle for the ones we want to print.</Review>

     <Review>This camera was given to me as a gift. My mom has the exact same camera - just red, of course! I&apos;ve already used it on my travels. I appreciate how easy it is to turn on to snap a quick picture. It&apos;s the perfect little thing to just put in a small case and take traveling, casually going out to eat, or just taking pictures around home. I travel extensively overseas, so it&apos;s nice and easy to travel with while capturing never-to-be forgotten moments in time. Pictures come out blurry on the timer shots. One thing I&apos;ve found is that some of the pictures come out fuzzy, but I know that has to be a setting I need to fix, as my mom&apos;s come out very nice - perfect! The video on it is superb!!</Review>

     <Review>Pros: HD Video and the compact size.

Cons: limited zoom capabilities, small LCD display.

My new ELPH 300 HS creates quality images. I have taken a variety of pictures, such as children and scenery. The compact size is amazing. My favorite feature is the slow motion video.</Review>

     <Review>Pros: Fast/accurate auto-focus; Easy To Use; Short Lag Time; Great Zoom; Good Image Stabilization; Good Image Quality; Good in Low Light; Large Clear LCD; Small / Compact; Nice Body Color

I LOVE THIS CAMERA! I am a professional photographer, I tend to either shoot wide (I use a Canon 40D w/10-22USM most of the time) or very tight with shallow DOF... this camera does BOTH! And with gusto! The white balance in Auto mode is absolutely incredible. It picks up on 2 or more different light sources without overpowering the rest of the image with an unnatural color. The video quality is great. It&apos;s easy to use, fast, photos look amazing, and the wide-angle lens is a MUST-HAVE! I also love the rough exterior. It makes it super easy to hold, especially for a serial-dropper like myself. LOVE i ... t!

     <Review>Pros: Small / Compact

Cons: Poor Image Quality

I bought this to replace a SD1100IS that I dropped on vacation, and before that camera I was very happy with my Canon A95 Powershot.
This camera however seemed less. The pictures have a cartoon color to them and the features are severely limited when using the underwater case. I wished I hadn&apos;t rushed to replace my smaller camera, (I use a Nikon D200 for most serious shots) but based on my history with the powershots I felt safe. I now use this for times when I don&apos;t really care about images or having to pay attention to where I leave my camera. (Think parties, BBQs etc) I purchased a Nikon point and shoot that I am really happy with. The video on the Canon is OK, I was just disappointed that the image quality has gone dow ... n so much. The A95 at 5 mega pixels took crisper shots.

     <Review>I have had several Canon ELPH models over the years, and they generally get better and better. This one has a nice, non-slick surface and simplified controls that are easy to used. The new CCD design seems to be better at capturing low light shots. On the down side, some of the low light shots are very grainy, even when using the proper settings. Also, removing the SD card, removing the battery, or connecting eth USB cable are all very difficult to do without endangering the camera.</Review>

Cons: nothing so far!

I am so pleased with the quality of photos and easy of use of my new camera. I replaced a 5-year-old older brother of this Canon and it&apos;s a worthy successor. it&apos;s the fasted from on to picture of any camera I&apos;ve ever had. the menus are similar too which makes it easier for me to pick up all the different modes. and the size, it&apos;s TINY! but not too small and the LCD screen is a great size.</Review>

     <Review>I bought this camera a couple of weeks ago before my vacation to Colorado and I love it. It is so easy to use and learn all of the functions. There is one function that I am not used to, the panoramic stitch mode. It helps with the creation of panoramic photos by allowing you to line up a number of different photos. You need a computer program to actually create the panoramic look. I wish it had a panoramic mode that worked directly on the camera. All of the other functions are awesome. The photos come out so clear and beautiful. The battery life could be better. I have been messing with it a lot because it&apos;s new, so that may have something to do with it. I bought the black camera, which has a rough texture to it. I wasn&apos;t sure if I liked it at first but now I am used to it. It doesn&apos;t ... bother me at all. It makes the camera feel more durable and you can get a better grip on it. Overall, this is a GREAT camera. I would recommend it to anyone looking for an easy to use camera that takes beautiful pictures. It&apos;s worth every penny!

     <Review>Pros: Small and simple

Cons: Slow reload speed

This camera does what I want it to: take pictures without my thinking about it, in all light conditions. The metering is pretty sophisticated, though it&apos;s sometimes annoying to tell it that you want to decide where to meter. Low light quality is also pretty excellent. If you don&apos;t have delerium tremens, you can be reasonably assured you&apos;ll get a good shot without the flash anywhere. The lag time between shots is sometimes slow (my wife would say all the time), but admittedly, I&apos;ve not tried to find the &quot;take pictures fast&quot; setting. I never thought I&apos;d say this, but the camera is so low profile that it&apos;s sometimes hard to hold onto. Be careful on the boat, in other words. Fits in the pocket really nicely, though. I like the range ... of zoom - zoomed all the way out is fairly wide-angle, and slightly fisheye. Battery needs to be removed to recharge, which is one of the ways Canon makes it so small.

     <Review>Pros: Everything

Cons: Nothing

After six years with my Canon PowerShot S410 Digital Elph, I finally decided it was time for an upgrade.

This camera is half the size with twice the punch. The pictures are great. The features are cool (I particularly like Color Accent feature). Best of all, it&apos;s exactly what I wanted: a camera you can just point and shoot. The automatic feature on this camera does a very good job of adjusting to take the best picture.

I am definitely satisfied with this purchase and you will be too.</Review>

O-Stock always stands behind the products they sell plus their warranty programs are another excellent value. Picture and video are EXCELLENT. HD Video on this camera allows the zoom feature to work!</Review>

     <Review>I did a bunch of research prior to selecting this camera. It is great for the person that wants to quickly point and shoot and get excellent results every time. It does allow advanced users the ability to make fine tune adjustments and use some of the fancy features. But, for those who want great quality pictures and HD video, this is a great all in one. The abiltiy to directly connect this camera to your HD TV is an added feature that makes it even better. It is small enough to carry in your pocket, and with very few buttons, simple to use. Would definately suggest this to anyone looking for a great camera.</Review>

     <Review>Pros: Full featured pocket camera. Great picture and sound video. Low light ability. Fun shooting modes.

Cons: No panoramic sweep mode

I&apos;ve bought several Canon cameras for myself as well as family, and have never been disapointed. But this little thing blew me away. I bought this just before a vacation to Ireland. And was very pleased at the results. Besides the 1080 video quality, the sound recording was surprising for the size. The main reason I bought it was for the low light quality and it was great, even in video mode. Lots of fun features. I especialy liked the &quot;Smile&quot; mode. The auto mode left me with some fantastic pictures, macro as well as landscapes.. For a light weight pocket camera loaded with features, this is worth looking at.
( Unlike one of the previous re ... veiwers, I did like the rougher feel of the black case. It made it more secure to hold still especialy outdoors in misty weather.)

     <Review>This is my third Canon point-and-shoot camera. I replace them every few years as the technology changes. I do alot of video/slideshow productions, and I love the quality of the video on this camera. Took great video in low light at a concert. The slow motion video feature is so fun, just wish it had sound. Some reviews complain about the smallness of the buttons (for example the zoom in/out), but I have never found this to be a problem. Photo quality is great, but I still prefer my Canon SLR for important photo shoots. But you can&apos;t beat the size, convenience of this camera for capturing everyday events.</Review>

     <Review>Incredible - many different settings, incredible color and detail. Small, compact and great for capturing amazing memories. Great in low lighted areas. Most shots end up looking quite prfessional. Had another Cannon before this and it was awful. They really went up in value in the last couple years. Absolutely love it!</Review>

     <Review>Pros: A slim (fits in the pocket) camera with good HD video. Takes very good pics for a point-and-shoot. Nice that the lens is 5X (4.3 to 21.5 mm).

Cons: Slightly larger than my previous Canon ELPH the SD780 IS. Longer, wider and fatter. Not as good a feel as the previous one, and seems less well made. The buttons in my two-year-old model were metal, these are plastic. To shoot video in the old one, you simply put the setting from AUTO to the video icon, in this one, you must first put it to AUTO and then push another button, a small matter, but I suspect indicative of other less elegant design features.

I bought this camera to replace my beloved Canon ELPH SD780 IS. I had that one about two years and it took great pics, slid easily into my pocket, and was so simple an ... d easy to use. This new one, while with slightly better specs (lens, etc) seems to have been not as well designed.

     <Review>I bought this camera for my wife for everyday picture taking. We took the camera for a spin on our vacation to Hawaii. The things that are great about it: (1) It&apos;s very compact and lightweight, so it goes everywhere and easily fits in pockets and purses. Be warned, if you have large hands you might not like it or find it too small. (2) Picture quality is pretty good. It seems to handle outdoor and low-light situations pretty well. Haven&apos;t taken a very close look at the pictures yet, but at a glance they look good, colors are vivid and not washed out (a previous P&amp;S camera we had would consistently deliver washed-out colors). (3) It&apos;s simple enough to use with no mucking around, yet has various creative modes (including &apos;P&apos; or Program mode) that let you set things like ISO, flash, etc. ... Obviously it&apos;s not as flexible as the higher-end P&amp;S cameras or DSLRs, but for beginners or people who don&apos;t want to mess too much with settings it&apos;s IMHO a great camera. (4) Optical zoom range is good - wide is wide for landscape shots, zoom gets you sufficiently close to the action, and the IS helps you keep it steady. (5) Video quality is pretty good - I shot in 720p with no lag, and playback on camera and on PC seems good and smooth. (6) LCD is nice and big and bright. The main complaint, and it&apos;s a huge one, is that focusing is SLOW. I&apos;m talking amost 1/2 a second to acquire focus. Once it&apos;s there though, taking the actual shot is quick. However, I think we missed capturing a good number of fleeting moments due to the slow focus. Other minor complaints: In some wide-angle shots with flash, the lens actually interferes and casts a shadow on parts of the shot. It&apos;s readily apparent on some shots, but I think for the most part you might not notice. Also there&apos;s no optical viewfinder, but we use the LCD 100% of the time, so this doesn&apos;t bother us at all. Despite the focus lag, I think this is a pretty good camera for someone who wants a compact, lightweight camera to take on vacation, or for everyday shooting where you don&apos;t want to deal with a variety of settings. If quick focus is important to you, there are other P&amp;S cameras with faster times, or you may want a consumer/prosumer DSLR.

     <Review>Pros: images(low light and macro)

Cons: menu set up is confusing at first

I was trying to decide between the Canon s95, the canon sx230 hs and this one. The S95 is great if you want to spend the money and want a lot of control, but the video is just ok and has only 3.8x zoom. The sx230 hs is a little cheaper has 14x zoom and full HD video, but I found the images underwhelming and low light photos are still very grainy. Also the GPS is not essential. The Elph 300hs does not have all the manual features or the mega zoom but if I wanted that I would just get a DSLR. The pictures(both low light and macro) and video are excellent, the lcd is clear and bright, and it is almost HALF the price of the s95.</Review>

     <Review>This is replacing a similarly-sized Panasonic point and shoot from a couple years ago. Compared to the Panasonic, this has significantly less noise in low-light shots, a bit more zoom, a bit wider angle, and better video. I was up in the air between this one and larger superzoom model. I waited until I could see both in person, and picked this one. Simple reason: this Canon takes infinitely better pictures than any camera that isn&apos;t with me at the time. I&apos;m just more likely to carry this camera with me than something that doesn&apos;t fit in my pocket. This size camera is a compromise: it takes significantly better pictures than a cell phone camera, but doesn&apos;t have the zoom or flash power of a larger camera. It&apos;s still small enough that I can justify carrying in my pocket in addition to ... my cell phone.

The whole body feels like a rough skin, sort of..makes it easy to handle even when not looking at it. Beautiful color rich photos, the only drawback is that I can&apos;t control the resolution until I load them on the computer.</Review>

     <Review>Pros: Nice Body Color; Easy To Use; Large Clear LCD; Small / Compact

Cons: Lag / Shutter Delay; Poor Image Quality

Well, Let&apos;s begin with the Pros: Fits great in my pockets, very slim and compact! This is the initial reason I was attracted to it and paid [$] It takes decent pictures in daylight and well lit rooms.Cons: I expected the photo quality to be a lot better from this Canon. Unfortunately it did not meet my expectations. It&apos;s terrible in low light. It takes for ever to auto focus in a dim rooms like bars which is where I primarily wanted to use it. So, I find myself trying to take a pic and it could take many many seconds before the picture is taken. It&apos;s a bummer. Also the color quality isn&apos;t what I have expected from a Canon camera. I own 3 older models and are muc ... h happier with them. Unfortunately I can&apos;t comment on the video becuase I haven&apos;t really used it. If this camera broke today...I would not buy it again.Dennis Jarrin

     <Review>This camera has everything you could want in a sweet little size at a very reasonable price. The highlights for me:

- low light sensitivity...they are not kidding this is awesome for night shots but also for low light situations where other cameras will auto flash and overexpose. Just point and shoot, no fiddling with settings.

- automatic macro...get in close and it switches to macro on its own. This is really handy for a plant lover like myself. Its macro is also very decent.

- 1080p HD with stereo sound. Need I say more? Check out reviews/videos on youtube and you&apos;ll see what I mean.

I LOVE LOVE LOVE this camera. I bet you will, too. And by the way, Dell.com offered the best price at the time and shipped really quickly. I got a bundle with a case and 8GB SD c ... ard. It was only offered in silver and I preferred the red but I will live.

     <Review>I have an older ELPH 500 and still use it. I like the quality of pictures, the camera size, ease of use, and the screen size of the ELPH 300. It&apos;s great to have a small camera to put in the pocket and have available to take pictures in moments indoors or out. It is also easy to download pictures onto the computer or to a printer.</Review>

     <Review>I have had the camera about 2 weeks. I love it. It is easy to use and takes great pics. My 2 previous cameras were Canon and so I already know how great the pics are. The software from my PS SD870 IS was much easier to use, but I will get used to this newer upgrade to the Zoom Browser I hope. I have not used all of the options it has, but love the fact that I can use auto or choose the settings myself. I also like the children/pets mode for faster shooting of moving pets and children. The 229 price was well worth it for this camera. The camera is VERY thin and might be a little small for people with big hands, but I have small hands and it fits perfectly. It is small enough for my purse or a pocket.</Review>

     <Review>Pros: Ease of use, features, quality

Cons: Can&apos;t always trust auto setting to capture people clearly. Can not use two settings at once

After wanting to throw my three Kodak&apos;s against the wall for ruining so many precious family moments, I did hours of research and settled on this camera. I am loving it! I&apos;ve had it for about two weeks and highly enjoy playing with it. It&apos;s easy to use although it took me a time or two to get &quot;speedy&quot; with the changing of settings; I was used to the Kodak settings. I am adoring the color effect and vivid settings--two I wasn&apos;t sure I&apos;d ever use. The scenery shots I have taken--especially in vivid--are stunning. The optical zoom during video make a very slight buzzing sound but if you have other noise going on in the video, you hardly notice it ... (if at all!) and it doesn&apos;t cut out the main audio you want to capture (unlike my Kodak optical that would totally override the desired audio with a loud cranking sound) I do advise you be careful when taking pictures of people. I had mine on auto today instead of portrait with face AiAF enabled and unfortunately it made the background trees crystal clear while blurring the people. It was a one time shot of a group of preschool children posing infront of a Redwood. I am very upset it did that but lesson learned: Take the extra second to put it on portrait; don&apos;t trust auto to always make people crystal clear. Otherwise my only other &quot;complaint&quot; is not being able to use two features at once such as fisheye in black and white or sepia. I&apos;d love to be in a monotone setting and be able to use another setting with it. I really would have given this camera a 4 1/2 stars out of five if I could have. Four is not quite giving it the justice it deserves. *Reminder* invest in a good class 10 SD card for write time and storage space (there is no internal memory). Those 1080 videos take up a lot of room! (Sidenote--I personally love the rougher black texture)

     <Review>My husband and I have always been partial to Canon cameras even though we&apos;ve had Nikon and other popular brand cameras in the past. We currently own the Rebel Ti and use that as our main &quot;pro photo&quot; equipment. We also hike, backpack, rock climb, kayak, and these activities require a lightweight point and shoot camera that can capture the usually momentary scenes that catch our eye - so we bought this one.

The pictures are crisp, colors are true, and the optical zoom is great. We&apos;ve taken a wide range of pics from macros of budding flowers and insects to panoramics at various times of the day and the pictures come out very well. Of course, you need to know how to use the camera and the settings are easy to figure out if you&apos;ve been using Canon for a while. People who see our adventur ... e pics frequently ask what we take our pictures with and they are surprised when we tell them we use an ELPH point and shoot. Not only that, maybe only 1% (one percent!) of the time would we have to do any post-shoot image editing.

There are a copule of caveats - if you have big hands, manipulating the camera could be tricky. This is also not a rugged camera you can drop (we&apos;ve dropped one before on a hiking trip and that was the end of it) and expect it to survive. I would recomment rugged waterproof housing for the camera - but it&apos;s worth the extra weight.

     <Review>Pros: Good Image Quality; Good in Low Light; Good Image Stabilization; Nice Body Color; Small / Compact; Easy To Use

Cons: No Viewfinder; Lag / Shutter Delay

This is a great replacement for my Canon 600. The image quality is remarkably good. The HD video quality was surprisingly good. The camera is great in low light. Hard to frame in bright light with no viewfinder. 

The lag time for action shots make it unacceptable for sporting events. The extra wide field of view make good landscape or group shots but poor for wild life shots. Be careful when using video not to place your fingers on the top of the camera. The stereo microphones pickup the noise clearly. The camera focused really well in low light for both video and still shots!

All-in-all the camera is great ... for some things and not so well suited for others. If it fits your needs it is a superb little camera. It will do the same as a new flip video camera as well as a good point and shoot camera all in one!

The NB-4L battery fits many older Canon cameras so you may already have a few lying around. The SDHC uses the newest chips. A 16GB class 10 will take more than 6000 images and/or an hour of video.

     <Review>I bought the Elph as a shower gift for my granddaughter and her husband. Perfect for photos and videos of the coming baby! They were delighted by its size and the zoom abilities--the wider angle was a hit. Also, they plan to use Auto mostly as they want to focus on the behavior of the baby. It is so compact it will be always with them and of course the perfect camera is the one you actually have with you when something you want to record actually happens</Review>

     <Review>Pros: Takes good pics

Cons: In auto mode, slaow to take pic

Have not played with all features, but pics look pretty good and it is neat to go between the manual and auto settings, then to record video. Only complaint is some times taking pics in auto is a little sluggish because I think it is trying to do a lot of evaluation so the best picture can be taken. Due to the sluggishness, some times those &quot;important&quot; shots may have been missed. Battery life is awesome as well. Have not checked out how the video is on TV though.</Review>

     <Review>Pros: The pictures

Cons: The lense retraction breaks so easily. I have owned 4 and have all died in less than a year because of the lense.

This camera is compact and fits in your pocket. It takes great pictures in all light. But it lasts less than a year if you are active at all or have children. If it is dropped or knocked over whether the camera is on or off, the lense is affected and it will not retract anymore. The camera will not operate if the lense malfunctions. I have had 4 in three years. 2 died within the purchased warranty period. I will not buy another one.</Review>

     <Review>Awesome little pocket camera. Purchased as a pre-wedding gift for my sister. I took a bunch of pics during the ceremony and reception, they came out great. Semi-rough/textured surface helps keep a solid grip on the camera. Only issue is its natural to cover the flash with your finger, but easy to get used to. The newlyweds took the camera to the Cayman Islands on their honeymoon and all the pics look beautiful. Overall, very compact and great photos and build quality for the price.</Review>

     <Review>Been looking for a pocket camera for a while now. Sometimes, it&apos;s great to have a compact camera were the need to take along full SLR gear is not needed. The Powershot 300 HS fits the bill very well. The camera is extremely easy to use. Images are clear and crisp, even if just left in Auto! The modes under the Program mode are great to have some fun with as well. As a SLR user, it was mentally hard not being in control all the time, but it was a pleasant surprise at the results of this camera. Well worth it.</Review>

Cons: Nothing!

Bought this camera to have a smaller camera to take on a once-in-a-lifetime trip to Jamaica. Could not have been happier! Easy to use, lightweight, took GREAT pictures (and I have a history of &quot;shaky&quot; photographs) For the price, you simply can&apos;t beat it. Buy with confidence.</Review>

     <Review>Pros: CMOS, small size

Cons: Video not in MP4 or AVI format

This is the most compact, sleek, and slim CMOS pocket camera in the consumer market. In terms of size, portability, and function, this is about as perfect as I know. It also takes night city light pictures fairly well without a tripod. In summary, an awesome little camera good for day and night.</Review>

     <Review>Pros: Such awesome quality for it&apos;s price.

Cons: Have to make sure the camera is focused before recording video.

I use this camera as a vlogger on YouTube and I wouldn&apos;t recommend anything else higher than this. The camera is such great quality for it&apos;s price it&apos;s almost like I&apos;m stealing the camera from Best Buy! 1080p is true 1080p quality unlike some cameras out there. This is the perfect camera for anybody, even professionals out there who just need a small cheap second camera for small stuff. Just make sure you buy the warranty with it, it scratches up very easily. I used it almost daily for about 8 or 9 months before it was dropped multiple times and died. They replaced my camera in the store with the accidental warranty. Easy to use, great quality camera for sure.</Review>

     <Review>I bought this camera for a vacation and it was perfect along with my 16GB SDHC card. I didn&apos;t need to take videos/images off the camera until I was back home.

The one thing I like about the camera was that I was able to edit the videos right on the camera such as trimming the videos or splitting them into two. I love this feature as space might be taken up by unnecessary footage and I create space even when I don&apos;t have access to a computer.</Review>

     <Review>Pros:
This is a compact camera with a powerful zoom.
It is super slim and is a point and shoot that produces very crisp pictures similar to the quality of the more costly larger cameras. The small size lets you either carry it around on your wrist with the included strap or slip it easily into your purse or pocket.

Cons:
Haven&apos;t found one yet.

Review:
Super camera super price!</Review>

     <Review>Pros: Easy to use, great price, fast picture taking WITH accuracy

Cons: Well it&apos;s small so maybe it&apos;s easier to lose?

It knocked my Nikon S6200 out of the water! The pictures were about the same quality BUT the Canon is so much easier to use. I had to take the pictures &quot;just right&quot; with the Nikon and it ALWAYS wanted to focus on anything BUT my intended subject. The Canon not only quickly focuses, takes pics, and is ready for the next shot in a snap, but it also follows the subjects if you want it to, and has an amazing burst mode. This is the best compact camera I&apos;ve had. Better than my Cyber-shots too. And, if you get it on sale, it&apos;s worth the price!
I did have reservations about the 5x optical zoom. The Nikon had 10X but honestly it&apos;s not a huge difference when you tak ... e into account the quality of pictures is higher on the Canon

The rechargeable battery does not take long to charge. The pictures come out well and I really like the zoom on this. Plus it fits into my back pocket!</Review>

     <Review>Very compact and handy, I take it everywhere instead of lugging my DSLR all the time. Make sure you have a fast SDHC card. The camera has an array of useful scene modes, also the slow motion video capability is very interesting and entertaining. It takes a little bit exploring to study the menu, once you get it, it&apos;s a breeze. The black body has sand-papery feeling to it, the red and silver ones are smooth.</Review>
