     <ReviewTitle>DCRP Review: PowerShot G12</ReviewTitle>

     <Review>Pros: Very good photo quality, with about a full stop advantage over typical compact cameras at high sensitivities; Nice 5X zoom lens with 28 - 140 mm range; New and improved &quot;hybrid&quot; optical image stabilization; Well built, rangefinder-style body; Flip-out, rotating high resolution 2.8&quot; LCD display -- good outdoor and low light visibility; Optical viewfinder;
Snappy performance in most respects; Full manual controls, with support for RAW format; Smart Auto mode picks one of twenty-eight scene modes for you; Customizable menu, buttons, and spots on mode dial; Useful HDR, dynamic range, and shadow correction features; Powerful flash; Built-in neutral density filter and electronic level; Records movies at 720p (24 fps) with stereo sound and wind filter; Very expandable: supports an exter ... nal flash, remote shutter release, teleconverter lens, underwater case, and more; Above average battery life; HDMI output

Cons: Controls can be intimidating at first -- small and cluttered buttons, especially zoom and four-way controllers and shutter release button; Lens can be seen through optical viewfinder when at wide-angle position; Some redeye, though removal tool in playback mode got rid of it; Can&apos;t use optical zoom in movie mode -- 24 fps frame rate a bit choppy; Wish list: faster lens, WB bracketing, ability to set color temperature; No memory card included; can&apos;t access memory card slot while using a tripod; Full manual on CD-ROM

You&apos;d expect great things from Canon&apos;s flagship compact camera and, in most respects, the PowerShot G12 delivers. It offers a solid (though somewhat cluttered) design, great photo quality, features for beginners and enthusiasts, HD video, and more optional extras than anything else in its class. Sure, a faster lens, further improved movie mode, and an actual printed manual would be nice, but I guess those will have to wait for the next model (or so I hope). For now, though, the PowerShot G12 is a good choice for those wanting near-D-SLR image quality, performance, and expandability in a more portable body.

_
When I last looked at Canon&apos;s G Series PowerShot, things were a lot simpler. The G10&apos;s competition was Panasonic&apos;s LX3 and Nikon&apos;s P6000.
This time around, it&apos;s the Panasonic LX5 and the Nikon P7000 fighting it out with the Canon G12 as each company&apos;s flagship digicam. But there&apos;s a lot more competition for your camera dollar. Even from Canon, whose much more compact S95 may make you wonder which model is the flagship PowerShot.
And beyond that, there are the mirrorless cameras from Sony, Panasonic, Olympus, and Samsung that are more compact than a dSLR if larger than a digicam, but offer better image quality than a digicam.
The real debate this year isn&apos;t Canon, Nikon or Panasonic. It&apos;s more a question of how small you want the box to be and how large you need the sensor to be.
On those counts, the Canon G12 would seem to be disadvantaged with a big body and a small sensor. The S95, like the LX5, has a very desirable small body but a small sensor, and the mirrorless cameras are bigger both in form and sensor.
*Look and Feel*. So size is an issue. And if you&apos;re looking for a very small camera with excellent quality and full features, you might just fall in love with the S95. The Canon G12 is going to look too big to you and feel as heavy as a brick in your bag.

     <Review>The Canon PowerShot G12 is an advanced compact camera that can fit in your pocket, yet provides a full gamut of manual controls and a relatively big zoom. It&apos;s the type of camera you should consider if you want something that will give you full creative control and a flexible shooting range but without the bulk of a digital SLR and without the expense of an interchangeable lens camera.

Indeed, the Canon PowerShot G12 costs £539 and you don&apos;t have to change lenses to suit your shooting situation — it comes with a reasonably versatile 28-140mm zoom lens. However, the G12 does have some flaws; its image quality is a little too grainy for our liking, and its zoom lens exhibits plenty of barrel roll at wide angles. It could also use a better shutter button and more solid-feeling ... control buttons.

Canon PowerShot G12 versus PowerShot G11 versus PowerShot G10

The Canon PowerShot G12 replaces last year&apos;s PowerShot G11, which replaced the Canon PowerShot G10. The Canon PowerShot G11 had some notable differences with the PowerShot G10 (most prominently a 10-megapixel sensor on the G11 versus the 14-megapixel sensor on the G10), but the PowerShot G12 doesn&apos;t offer any significant advantages over the G11. It&apos;s very much an incremental upgrade that includes some fine-tuned adjustments to the overall offering.

In particular, the Canon PowerShot G12 can shoot in high-definition mode (1280x720 versus the G11&apos;s 640x480 video mode) and record stereo sound. The G12 has focus tracking, and it also offers a teensy bit more shooting speed compared to the G11 (up to 2 frames per second versus 1.3fps). The other main difference between the G12 and the G11 is that the G12 offers an expanded set of sensitivity settings: you can now select ISO levels such as 125, 160, 250, 320, 500, 640, 1000, 1250, 2000 and 2500.

A sample video shot at a Sydney Kings basketball game.

If you already own the G11, then apart from the features we&apos;ve just rattled off the Canon PowerShot G12 won&apos;t offer anything that you haven&apos;t seen before. It has the same 10-megapixel, 1/1.7in CCD sensor, the same f/2.8, 28-140mm zoom lens and the physical features of the cameras are practically identical. There are dedicated dials for changing the exposure compensation, shutter speed, aperture value and ISO speed, and there are also buttons for changing quickly to macro mode, switching to manual focus and selecting a custom focus point. Another handy feature is the auto-exposure button, which, when pressed, changes to the optimal exposure settings regardless of the shooting mode you are in. It can be very useful if you&apos;re shooting in changing lighting conditions and haven&apos;t yet figured out the correct exposure settings manually.

A 2.8in, hinged LCD screen can be used to frame your photos, and there is also an optical viewfinder that can be used as a fallback if the conditions are too bright and you just want to get your bearings. However, the optical viewfinder doesn&apos;t reflect what is seen by the lens, nor does it show you the correct focus, so it doesn&apos;t give you an accurate representation of the frame you are about to capture. Basically, you&apos;ll always need to use the LCD screen.

The Canon PowerShot G12&apos;s body feels sturdy overall, but we hate its shutter button, which is too squishy and doesn&apos;t have a distinct two-step feel to it. The buttons on the rear also have a slightly cheap feel to them, but they are easy to press for the most part. We think the front dial for the aperture is a little too stiff; we&apos;d prefer it to be looser, as moving the aperture one step up or down can be a little difficult.

Canon PowerShot G12: picture quality

The Canon PowerShot G12&apos;s picture quality is great overall. It can capture accurate colours and reasonably clear images, but it does suffer from noise, which becomes especially noticeable when you closely crop your photos. The bright f/2.8 lens means you can shoot with a relatively slow ISO speed in low-light conditions, which should help keep the noise down. If you choose any...

The Canon PowerShot G12 is one of critics&apos; favorite digital cameras.

     <Review>This camera is great for everybody. I am a pro that uses a pair of 1D Mark 3s and a 5D, and my girlfriend is a photographic novice. Next month she is touring France; so, I wanted her to take a camera that can shoot in Hi-Res RAW, jut so I can have the ability to really tweak her shots in case she composes something wonderful. She refuses to deal with my big, bulky DSLRs, and insists on a camera that will fit in her purse; so, a point-&amp;-shoot is the only option. The Canon G12 really fits the bill. In casual situations she can turn the dials [Mode &amp; ISO] to AUTO and always get a great shot indoors or at night. I&apos;m teaching her to use the Manual, Time Value, Aperture Value, and Program modes for those more important shots of beautiful landscapes and famous landmarks, such as the Norma ... ndy Coast or the Eifel Tower. The G12 is setup like a DSLR in that it has almost all of the needed dials and buttons on the outside of the body for quick and easy location and use. No need to fumble through deep, multilayered menus in order to change your ISO, shutter speed or aperture. It even has an over/under exposure dial [+/- 2.0 in 1/3rd-stop increments] right on top of the box. it has a hot shoe for when she needs that extra burst of light, yet the built-in flash is more than adequate for most impromptu situations. The flip out screen is big and bright and flips-image when turned towards the subject. It also has an optical viewfinder [not a mini-LCD] that allows composing and shooting with the big screen off so you she can really extend your battery life on those long days away from AC outlets. Some other cool functions are Face Recognition, Subject Tracking, Blink Sensor, and Image Stabilization. Plus it shoots in HD-720p video. The only downsides are the lens&apos; focal length, and JPG only in Auto mode; however, it will record in RAW in all manual modes. The Canon SX30 has a much better lens, but it does not record in RAW. Also, Adobe PhotoShop CS4 and PhotoShop Elements 8 [and earlier] cannot open the G12&apos;s CR2 RAW files without the use of Adobe&apos;s DNG Converter. PS -CS5 and Elements 9 with the latest Adobe camera RAW Plug-In Update [6.3] have no problems. For those non-PS users, the G12 comes with a disk of Canon&apos;s regular compliment of digital photo software that will work just fine. All in all, I love this camera. My girlfriend is already capturing images of professional quality, and now I have a point-&amp;-shoot that lets me leave my DSLRs at home... sometimes.

     <Review>Pros: The Good: I took a brand new G12 on a two week trip through Europe, becoming familar with it on the flight over. Seriously. One thing that blew me away: The controls are almost exactly the same for various modes as my ancient A-1 from the 1970s! 

That aside, low light capability is incredible - shooting yachts in Monte Carlo pre-dawn yield excellent results. The same for the interior of Blue Mosque and Haga Sophia in Istanbul. I used the adjustable LCD screen as the view finder while the camera was pointed straight up at the ceilings of St Peter&apos;s and the Vatican museum in Rome. The auto stabilization worked very well as I took video while walking. 

I enjoy the size and feel of the camera, especially given my large hands. As a tourist, I enjoy using one device for photo ... s and videos. While the videos are not as good as my JVC HD, they are acceptable if you don&apos;t mind poor sound quality.

As others said, the auto efaults need tuned to keep the ISO from being forced unacceptably.

Cons: The Bad: Why does Canon insist on shipping a camera of this quality and price with a neck strap only? The hassle of finding a wrist strap torques me.

The Ugly: This camera, while good, should not be $500; this is unacceptable, and loses one egg.

Since my purchase a few months ago, I have used this camera on two vacations, as a guest in three weddings, and a few other family functions. I have other cameras, but the G12 has become my default. Once you adjust settings to your personal tastes it will achieve 90 - 95% of what I seek in a DSLR, save for very long focal lengths - which I rarely use these days.

I found the battery life very good assuming I didn&apos;t shoot video exclusively. I purchased a spare from a 3rd party at a reasonable cost and with a good life.

Also, I use no-loss image compression for outstanding prints.

If you can find this model on sale in the high $300 or low $400 range grab it.

     <Review>A wonderful experience! I am a photographer who shoots with quite a bit of different cameras - a view camera, polaroid, DSLR and a flip camera. The G12 has been, by far, the most enjoyable camera to work with. There is a lot of power in this small box. It is convenient and takes fabulous images. I love that it has excellent manual settings, variable formats for shooting and great video resolution. It&apos;s an awesome investment for photographers, and it&apos;s user friendly for those who want an excellent point and shoot!</Review>

     <Review>I&apos;ve owned all Nikon products up till now. I compared products, read reviews &amp; forums then decided on the G12 over the Nikon P7000. It&apos;s a great camera with alot of control options. The photos seem great on my Mac, though I haven&apos;t developed any yet. I give 4 instead of 5 stars because: 1. cannot shoot raw in auto setting 2. slow shutter has a cap of 15 seconds (Nikon &amp; Panasonic go to 60 sec) 3. video is just ok. Everything else is great for me. I use the tilting screen more than I thought, battery life seems great, the chunky size has been more of a benefit than a hindrance. (I have big hands)</Review>

     <Review>Pros: Features, Battery life, LCD screen

Cons: large, expensive

I purchased this camera from Best Buy while it was on sale and I am glad I did. I love the camera, but there are better camera&apos;s for only a little more than it&apos;s normal list price. I found this camera because I was looking for something better than a point and shoot and cheaper than a DSLR and for that this camera is perfect. My last camera was a Canon so the buttons and menus are all familiar to me, but I still think it would be manageable for someone without Canon background. As far as size, the camera does fit in some pockets, but if portability is a priority, look else where.</Review>

     <Review>Very glad I upgraded from G10. G12 moves my non-DSLR photography into new territory for low-light, HDR, and supported (non-tripod) shooting. Took it out to the Museum at sunset and easily caught awesome hand-held sunset and dusk scenes. Next, in the museum galleries I easily photoed historic artifacts in the very dim lighting using higher ISO settings 800-1600 with virtually no noise--a vast improvement over the G10 sensor! The articulated active LCD display (introduced on the G11) brought so many new angles to my shooting. I could place the camera against a wall for support and then virtually shoot over my shoulder or around a corner by twisting the LCD screen for viewing. This museum frowns on tripods, so the angled screen allowed me to still do supported shots at lower shutter speeds. O ... utside, with a short travel tripod, I twisted the LCD upward to comfortably compose my shots without bending or stooping--my knees and thighs thank you, Canon. Most of my shooting was done in Av or M mode. I also used the in-camera HDR bracketing/processing to turn out some nice JPEG HDR files of night time scenes that really showed what my eyes saw. Downside on the auto-HDR is that it is full automatic with no control over ISO, Aperture, or Shutter speed. You get what you get and I could find no facility to adjust exposure parameters for HDR shooting. Nevertheless, it is a useful capability and if I want more control I can always set up for exposure bracketing and post-process the scene outside the camera. Also, I think Canon has reached the limit on how many buttons/dials they can put on a small body. I found my fingers often mistakenly brushing buttons, leaving me to wonder what control I had invoked. I also had trouble feeling if my right index finger was on the zoom lever or the new front dial. Menus and LCD display controls are awesome--especially the new level indicator. I found myself constantly using the level. Overall, I found the G12 a great new advancement of the Canon G-series! Warning: Aperture 2 will not import G12 raws--you have to either upgrade to Aperture 3 or use the included Canon software to process the raw files.

     <Review>Prior to buying the G-12, I used the G-10 as my day-to-day camera. It is perfect for those times when it isn&apos;t practical to carry a DSLR with all the gear that goes along with it. My initial impression was that the G-12 didn&apos;t seem to be as rugged at the G-10, but I think that the rotating screen may have something to do with that. The few pictures that I have taken so far have been great. The low-light feature does an awesome job, though it does reduce the resolution significantly. Still, the shots are great for web. (I haven&apos;t printed one yet.) The few shots I have taken using the HDR have turned out well, though nothing compared to what can be done with software that gives the user more control. But, it is a nice feature to have, and I am looking forward to seeing just how much ... it can do. I am rating the camera a 5, and I still haven&apos;t even played with the HD video yet. This is a really nice camera, at a great price.

     <Review>What I think.

1. External Speedlite control - you still need a &quot;Master&quot; unit like a 580EX II or Canon STE2 to control external Speedlites. I almost considered going the Nikon route just to have that feature built in.

2. The screen is only 460K resolution. But very good.

3. The pathetic optical viewfinder. You are catering to those people that say a camera MUST have one of these - stop it. You are wasting space

4. The rear control wheel is too small - enlarge it so it feels more like one of your DSLRs.

5. While the lens is gorgeously sharp.

6. The lens needs to be wider - 24mm f/2 (or even f/1.8 in the Samsung) equiv is the primary reason I tried the LX5 and TL500 before going back to Canon.

7. No microphone input for video recording.

 ... 8. Just the right size - do not slim it down (and do NOT remove the articulating display).

So 8 things like that might sound like a big deal - but believe me when I say this - the camera is phenomenal.

Image quality is outstanding - I have had to process my RAW files with their converter (typically use Adobe Photoshop - but even with their converter image quality is second to none in the compact world. The lens is magnificently sharp. HD video results look pretty good - but not stellar. It&apos;ll do in a pinch - but its no camcorder replacement.

Operation speed is very very good. I have read a few posts saying that focusing speed is vastly improved from the G11 - I haven&apos;t found that to be the case but none-the-less its pretty good.

Construction quality is pretty good - but I love the rough textured finish more than the smooth finish on the G11 - it somehow makes it G11 feel cheaper.

Controls are absolutely second to none. Dedicated EV and ISO dials are wonderful. The new front control dial is great. The rear dial however could use a bit of an extension - hard to operate quickly with my fat thumb. kill the awful optical viewfinder.

Value for the money is mostly good - but if you are like me and need on-camera control of extern ...

     <Review>Pros: Price versus Value

Cons: Not all filters will fit lens

After drooling over the camera for months on end, I bought one! The Best Buy price is the lowest during this special. On to the review!

I have a ten-year-old Sony Cybershot that is working great, but it is just at the end of its service life; the G12 is a hand-in-glove replacement. This camera feels very good; solid and weighty. If you are used to vintage 35MM optical SLR cameras, the transition is easy owing to the ergonomics the S12.

The battery must be charged before use and heed the instructions about depleting the battery before storage and charging it before a photo session.

Windows 7 (64 Bit) already has appropriate drivers in the OS. I did not install the software that came with the came ... ra. Other OS’s may require you do install Canon’s software.

The USB receptacle is a “human” type. I used an old USB cable from whatever. Of course, you can always pop out the memory card and use your reader port.

The photos are first rate and the zoom is more like a long focal length tele lens. I thought of getting a 1A Sky filter to protect the lens; Canon sells this filter. Other brands may not fit. Ditto: other accessories.

     <Review>1 The lcd is fantastic, allows to take pictures or movie shoots in practical any position and situation, nice also when you are taking videos or do not want to be noticed when you are shooting, getting more spontaneous photos. 2 The ergonomic of the wheels for ISO,compensation and the mode selector are very well located, they work firmly. 3 The new front wheel, that works for increase or decrease the aperture or shutter speed is great. 4 The menu is easy to use and I like the new formats and sizes you can take pictures, 10:9, 4:3, 1:1, 3:2, 4:5 allows to get a better composition and photo formats without crop the image. 5 the rugged feel is nice for me, besides is only in two parts of the camera, where your hand and fingers needs more support. 6 At first instance I though the optical view ... finder appears to be so simple and awful like somebody told before, but, the diopter corrector works fine and when I clean the visor glasses, become so clear and nice that actually I am using it a lot, because do not need to open the lcd screen and it is possible to see the green or orange light which tells you that the exposition is ok or not, going back to the old times. 7 I did not test enough the video, but at first look, it is ok and allows to record some interesting moments. 8 The quality of the pictures is awesome, really love it, finally can get almost the quality I have with my DSLRs but in a small camera. 9 It is fast, is ready to take pictures maybe in a second. 10 The quality of the lcd screen may be is not the best, but, allows you to see if the picture is ok, and normally if you see that the picture is ok, when you opened in any software the picture is !really great! 11 for me all the wheels are well located, the buttons are in the right place, I have a normal hands size, use xl gloves, but have not fat fingers. 12 The autofocus works great, fast and with an excellent accuracy, feature not easy to find in a small camera, so reduces the possibility of loosing a nice photo. 12 Could be perfect, but nothing is.

     <Review>My usual cameras are DSLRs with heavier bodies and lenses. Sometimes I want to be a less serious photographer or just want to carry less equipment. The Canon G12 is a camera that is pocket sized and takes reasonable photos. The camera s only big negative is the viewfinder. It simply is too small to be usable. The G12 batttery life is short compared to my intermediate camera batteries. But usually I do not use flash with my other camers. I did use automatic flash with the G12 and that drains a battery more quickly. The Canon G12 would be a great camera for someone who wants to learn photography without spending a fortune but who wants to produce great shots. Controls are easy to find and use the manual is well written and camera features are best you can get in this price range.</Review>

     <Review>I shoot video and stills with a Canon 5DMKII. I wanted a small coat pocket type camera for personal use. The G12 seems to be the best thing available in a compact camera. It&apos;s an evolution, not something new so reliability is proven. For still photography you can access full manual control--not as easily as with a DSLR but still pretty good once you get the hang of it. Video is unfortunately only 720p HD, but it is 24 frames per second, which is significant. I&apos;ll take lower resolution to keep within my 24 fps world over higher resolution at a different frame rate. Unfortunately, they cripple video functions and you do not have the same level of control as when shooting stills. You do have the internal ND filter, which is important, and you can lock focus and aperture to keep them from ... changing when shooting. However, manual aperture control is limited and in some conditions you are forced to shoot with auto aperture to maintain correct exposure. For home movies that&apos;s probably OK, but if you plan to get an occasional shot to include with more professional video, it is a problem. The lens is good and sharp and the camera has a heavy, solid feel. I&apos;ve heard that lots of professional still photographers keep it in their coat pockets or purse for those situations where they don&apos;t want to take their big cameras, and that&apos;s a great use for it. Not quite so great for the videographer to do the same thing, but it is useful within its limitations. Battery life is excellent, and the optical viewfinder is useful sometimes, within limits.

     <Review>Pros: I have the venerable Powershot G2 from almost 10 years ago. Sensor is finally going (testament to its longevity) so I decided it was time for an upgrade. Not disappointed at all!

Fantastic functionality in a small package. While the lens is small (smaller than the G2), it is larger than most &quot;point and shoot&quot; cameras (better than phone lenses), and the sensor within is top notch. Great color reproduction. Fast - take a shot and while it is being previewed, tap the shutter button briefly and you are ready to shoot again. Auto white balance is great and offers a manual calibration mode to get the best colors from the environment you are shooting in.

Works great for underwater photos and video as well.

Cons: Auto functions? Honestly why bother including them ... on something like this. Do yourself a favor and learn the camera and shoot consistently on the &quot;P&quot;rogram mode (or other adjustable modes), and shoot with RAW.

Overall body has nice grip and weight, but honestly is a bit small to hold in large hands. I missed some of the bulk and flair to grip onto from the old G2. Solution: attach a tripod plate to the camera which offered decent finger grip on the underside. For others this will probably be a non-issue.

Glad I got it while it was discounted, but really, it&apos;s worth it&apos;s current price ($499).

As for the 4 egg rating - I really didn&apos;t dock an egg due to negativity of the camera. I just rarely trust overly gushing 5-star reviews. I tend to read the 4 and 3 star reviews and thought others may do more of the same.

     <Review>Remarkable image quality from a body far smaller and lighter than the big heavyweights; perfect for on-hip carrying without being bothersome, discrete without attracting attention in terms of presence. Swing-out LCD is extremely functional. Backside buttons awkwardly tiny, literally require a finger-nail push, not a finger. Very, very many built in functions; 212 page manual indicative, and Canon-characteristically... not always written with clarity. Movie capability remarkably good all things considered, but as with all cameras of the sort: holding it steady is difficult - relative lightness. Once familiar with grip-comfort and weight of full-size cameras, anything less is awkward. Compactness is excellent. Roughly 3X as heavy as a toy-type point&amp;shoot and twice a big - well built and ... feels very solid. Proprietary battery, not AA&apos;s, but shooting-power capacity is most commendable. A well-seasoned product, has been around for years - a Classic is a worthy term, not simply the latest fad &amp; fashion. Capable of professional-image shooting when in the hands of a skilled person. Carry-ability is its acclaim and major asset. For the person not familiar with typical camera controls, tweaks and adjustments the G12 is ill-suited to that person, though Auto-everything does work well. Zoom range is worthy, as is the camera-shake stabilizer.

     <Review>Pros: Size; Flexibility; Picture Quality; Control Design

Cons: Cost of excessories

You can&apos;t take advantage of photographic opportunities if you don&apos;t take your camera along. I found the G12 a perfect balance of small size and image accuracy. It protects itself well from casual contact with the world of shoulder bags and cargo pockets without a cumbersome case. I added the Canon FA-DC58B filter attachment and a UV filter to allow wandering around in the woods with the camera on without fear of lens damage. The filter attachment extends when you zoom in and retracts about half way when you zoom out again. The attachment does get in the way of the view finder, but again I&apos;ll take the compromise.
If you&apos;re used to the way Canon organizes its menus you&apos;ll have no trouble learn ... ing the way this guy works. I don&apos;t need all the shooting options, the stuff like wink triggering or triggering when a face enters the frame, and I&apos;m not going to be doing any videos here. So had I designed my perfect camera it would have a larger sensor and fewer whiz-bang shooting options. But I&apos;m going to have a lot of fun exploring this guy.

     <Review>The camera is pretty easy to use right out of the box. Stick in a memory card and a charged battery, put in one of the auto modes, and you&apos;re good to go. But then I started reading the manual and discovered all sorts of features I might use one day. There&apos;s so much, it&apos;s scary. A wink-activated shutter? Ouchies! The main reasons I bought this camera are the flip out viewing screen, the RAW images it shoots, and the manual control. And it delivers on those counts quite well.</Review>

     <Review>I purchased the Canon G12 as a companion to my D-SLR for three main reasons: 1) I tend to mainly do Street Photography, and sometimes shooting with a large DSLR is too obvious and costs me shots when the subject notices my camera and shies away. 2) Some places (concert venues, etc.) prohibit entrance with anything they deem to be a Pro Camera - which usually means Any camera with a removable lens. I wanted a camera I could take in to such places while still getting high-quality shots in low-light conditions. 3) Sometimes I just don&apos;t want to lug around a heavy DSLR and lenses - but still want to shoot RAW and get great images. The Canon G12 has met and exceeded my desires and expectations in all categories! For Street Photography, I can mute all sounds, making the camera completely si ... lent (except for the sound of the zoom) and can shut off the Focus Assist Beam - providing me with a very discreet camera and the ability to shoot scenes without anyone knowing I am doing so. The auto-focus is fast and accurate... so I can trust the camera to deliver great shots, even from the hip. For low-light conditions this camera is amazing... providing results comparable to my Canon EOS 40D DSLR even at ISO 1600 - though anything higher than that and grain/noise does become noticeable in some situations. I tend to do 99.99% of my shooting relying on available light only, and have been very happy with the results I&apos;ve been receiving. As a substitute for my DSLR, this camera is amazing! Though far from being tiny, this camera is quite compact considering how much is packed into that body. I find it comfortable to hold and use... and can easily slip it into a jacket pocket. The picture quality is wonderful, and - shooting RAW - I have full control over all settings using the provided Canon Digital Photo Professional software. I don&apos;t tend to shoot much video, but have done so once with the G12 and was amazed by the results. The image quality was fantastic... and the sound was amazingly clear. Bottom line: I&apos;m in love with the Canon G12 and would highly recommend it!

     <Review>I am a TV journalist. I love photography. I like to take photographs about the stories that I cover. But my SLR camera is just too bulky for the job. G12 is giving me the opportunty to take manually adjusted RAW pictures and HD videos at the same time. I use the HD videos to support my stories too. In dangeros wor environments like Iraq the size and the ebilities are very helpful. Where ever I go I cary my G12. It is my new(s) body...I need a wider lens and 60 fraim per second Full HD option to be added in the future...</Review>

     <Review>What a thrill! I have been looking for a point and shoot with top notch quality. I am spoiled with the results of my Canon T2i with a 24-105 L and 135 2.0 L (I use to shoot inside high school drama productions). Years ago I had the Canon G2 and thoroughly enjoyed it. When it died (lens stuck), I could not afford to remain in the G line, so I purchased various quality Canon point and shoots, ultimately using the SX110IS. I liked the fact i could replace the AA batteries while camping and hiking (I used lithium). But I hungered to return to the G line. I was holding out for the sequel to the G12, which turned out to be the GX1. But wholly molly they want an arm and a leg for it. I decided on the G12 because of price and I could not be more thrilled. The lens is L quality. The fea ... tures are more than I could have imagined. I bought an extra battery. One observation that bothers me is Canon does not include a wrist strap. Instead, the box has a shoulder strap. I prefer a wrist strap. I am using the strap from my mothballed SX110IS. Right out of the box I took the camera on a three-day boy scout snowmobile trip and came back with 650 priceless photos. I look forward to years of great photos with this camera.

     <Review>Pros: well built. A lot of camera for little money (at current under $400 price).

Cons: really haven&apos;t found anything.

At it&apos;s new lower (under $400) price it is without question the best advanced point &amp; shoot on the market. Larger sensor than most p&amp;s cameras, fast, well built, can accept a hot shoe flash, swivel screen, HD video,ect... I mainly shoot with a DSLR but I wanted this for when I don&apos;t want to carry the bigger camera. I have not been unhappy with this camera. I have shot a few night photos at ISO 400 that are very clean (an area most p&amp;s cameras fail). All in all, a great buy. Oh, and for what its worth, the reason the price has been lower lately is there is word on the internet of a &quot;G&quot; series replacement coming for this camera in a couple of months ... . However, from what I have read the new camera will be around $800 and the improvements over the G12 are minimal and in my opinion not worth twice the price of the G12.

Wonderful all around compact camera. Excellent image quality and controls. Easy to make adjustments. Flip out multiangle view screen. Would like to charge battery in camera but can live without that feature. Battery charges fast in external charger and provides good battery life. Great value at under $400. Fast turn on time. Adjustable built in flash plus hot shoe. I really am happy with this camera.</Review>

     <Review>I am a professional photographer, and when I travel, I often bring two Nikon D700 with various lenses. The reason is that I was always afraid that I won&apos;t be able to take good quality photos. This year, I purchased Canon G12, and forced myself to bring this camera to my yearly European vacation. The torture of bringing big cameras is totally gone. The quality of the picture is pretty good as long as you do not use ISO higher than 640. I also purchased a radio remote control and a light Manfrotto tripod so that I can take picture of myself. I just do not like asking people to take picture of me, 99.9% people do not know how to take picture. You cannot use this camera if you really want to take serious high quality photos that you will blow up to a big size. But for vacationing, this came ... ra is MORE than enough. You can setup the camera like a real DSLR. As a result, you may totally be confused by the camera. This camera is not for a beginner who just want to do point and shoot. It is not easy to use this camera for those who do not know how to set up a camera. I do not recommend this camera for most people. You&apos;d better off just by cheapo point and shoot. You can only take advantage of this camera, if you know how to setup a camera. Otherwise, you will just waste your money. Even I sometimes need to think how to set up certain thing. Again, it is not an easy camera to setup.

     <Review>I&apos;ve had it only a few weeks but I have given it a rigorous workout. It&apos;s pretty quick to start up, continous shooting is acceptable and the pictures are of good quality. The controls are easy to work and there are many different options. I used some of the automatic settings at times simply because I didn&apos;t have much time to get really familar with the camera and they usually yieled good results. I especially liked the My Colors feature and I found the ND filter to be handy. I had read other reviews where they said the flash wasn&apos;t strong enough. I found it to be pretty strong and did not use my external, which I had carried with me. In fact, I had to power the flash down some. I used the low light setting a lot and was surprisingly pleased with the results. There was the occasio ... nal photo that had noticeable noise, but not too many. The only negative I thought was battery life. It really stinks. With the Canon battery, I got less than 200 shots. I had also bought a Pearstone brand as a backup battery and that lasted as long as the Canon one. When the battery starts to go-you&apos;d better change it quick! All in all, it was the perfect camera for the trip I took where I didn&apos;t want to lug around my DSLR and lenses, etc. I don&apos;t regret purchasing it.

     <Review>Pros: Quality of photos and manual control and flip out screen

Cons: Nada

I actually read quite a few reviews on this camera. It has exceeded my expectations... The video was the focus with most of the reviews I read. A lot of people were not happy with the video... I also have a 60D.
So video on the G12 was not an issue for me. I desired a small camera with excellent photo quality for those times I do not wish to lug around a larger camera. Anyhoooooo... It is an excellent smaller camera...</Review>

     <Review>I am a former 35mm (film)camera user. For the past number of years, I have been using a small point &amp; shoot, never really being satisfied with its diversity. The G12 has proven to be the answer for me. It is small enough to easily transport. Having the settings on the outside of the camera allows quicker manipulation. Auto setting is wonderful. Perfect pictures n low light. I also love the movable screen. Only change I would make is the power of the zoom, but I can live without it.</Review>

     <Review>I am an amature photographer. I have both a Nikon D90 and a D7000 which I like very much for serious photogrophy However, the Canon G12 allows me to put it in my pocket for quick snap shots while traveling. I have been amazed at the range of the lens and the clarity of the pictures. I have had the camera for a short period of time and I am still experimenting with all of the many possabilities available in the camera. It took me a while to get used to using the screen positions since I am used to the direct view finder. I tried the view finder on the G12, but I found it a little small and difficult to use. It is a pretty sophisticated little camera for its size. I haven&apos;t tried the movie option yet. Looking forward to that.</Review>

     <Review>Canon Provides a little camera which provides almost any manual setting you are used from an SLR. As a loyal SLR user I found most of the dials and buttons easy to use and very handy too. Most of the new mini cameras come with several manual settings embedded in their software. It is either very hard to find the right settings from complicated menus and hidden submenus. Canon G12 though, has everything underneath your fingertips. Makes changing controls and setting easily and fast while shooting as real photographer. Lens and the zoom range it provides quite competitive with its competitors and not too greedy either. G12 gives you the feeling of a professional touch on the design and outcomes while still small enough to carry in your pocket or your purse. I must say it is slightly heavier ... than similar mid range compact cameras, but considering opportunities it provides, totally worth it. One last note, flip-LCD screen was more handy than I thought it would be.

     <Review>I was undecided on what small camera would be best for traveling not wanting to carry the big canon w/lenses and accesories. I tried several but being old school need a viewfinder and like RAW capability. The B &amp; H salesperson suggested the G12. Having bought from B &amp; H before I trusted the sales person after he said he bought the same camera for his father for the same reasons. I love it, its small (one handed operation) shoots RAW, has all the manual capabilities, is lightweight, and with the adapter can take filters which is something wanted. It is a great little camera and plan to pack it on all my trips rather than the bulky SLR that I have missed so many shots with getting it out and set. The screen is a good double check for settings and light, but the viewfinged makes me ... feel like I am using a real camera rather than a toy.

     <Review>I am a Canon shooter. A while back when I was in search for a camera to supplement my Canon 7D, for the times that I didn&apos;t feel like lugging a bunch of stuff around, I decided to buy the Canon S95. At that time I looked at the G12 and decided that it was simply too big. I thought to myself, if i&apos;m gonna lug that around then I may as well take my SLR. Fast forward. Unfortunately, the S95 died. It fell victim to the dreaded Lens Error problem that I think several others have encountered. Being that i was away from home, and no able to go through the warranty to have it replaced I was soon in the market for another camera to supplement my DSLR. After looking at several other Canon Point an shoots, I found myself missing the quality of the S95. That was when I locked eyes on the G12, ... and it was love at first shot. After a few test shots in the store, I was shocked by the image quality and ergonomic design. There is a button and dial for everything. The layout of the camera is as good or better than any I&apos;ve used. The image quality is excellent and the RAW capability is something that i really like having for the pics that i want to work over with software (LR, PS, Aperture). My original thought that the camera is too big was soon forgotten. It may be larger than the S95, but carrying it around is significant lighter than carrying my 7D + lenses. The image quality is similar to the S95 however the ease of control, and DSLR likeness make it even even better. I am falling in love with the articulated display which makes shooting from strange angles possible. The screen alone has motivated me to make more creative photographs. I am disappointed that my S95 failed. For a second I considered buying another S95 but i&apos;m so glad that i decided to go with this camera. The fact is that it will never fit in your pocket but in terms of a camera that needs to be with me when i dont feel like packing the DSLR + lenses + accessories, this camera does just fine. The only thing that I think could be improved is the camera&apos;s overall speed (i.e. burst shooting capability, auto focus speed, zoom response), but then again, maybe i have been spoiled but the speed of the 7D. Overall this is an excellent camera, i&apos;m very happy i have it. It goes where the DSLR cant. It can&apos;t fit in a pocket but then again is there a great camera with all the controls of a DSLR that can?? Produces excellent images and videos. Its layout that puts all of its controls at your fingertips. And the articulated LCD has sparked my creativity.

     <Review>Pros: This camera is a perfect trade off between the limited capabilities of small &quot;point and shoot&quot; cameras and too bulky DSLRs. Takes beautiful photos, the low light / low noise capabilities are truly amazing - I have taken so many pictures that I never would have gotten because they are out of range of ANY flash - the flash rarely goes off when using the &quot;P&quot; program mode. If you were upset when you found out the pixel count fell, don&apos;t be - the resulting sensitivity is more than worth it.

I have owned a G6, G9, and now a G12 - I LOVE the Canon G series cameras. Just barely small enough to put in a hip / belt case and take with you - a camera is no good if it is in a camera bag in the trunk or back at the hotel! Video capablities are without equal in a package this size.

Co ... ns: More bulky than previous G series cameras and more plastic in the body. The G-9 had a metal body and was slimmer which made it more usefull as a wrist strap camera in a hip case. 

Camera does not come with a wrist strap - the Canon WS-30 wrist strap is perfect for this camera. Shame on Canon for charging so much for them when bought through Canon parts dept.

I have a DSLR and several smaller point &amp; shoot cameras - the Canon G series are my favorite. If you can see it this camera can photograph it - with quality. I prefered the G9&apos;s size and view screen, but this camera blows it away with better sensitivity and low noise.

     <Review>I bought this camera because I wanted a camera that can give me DSLR quality photos with a &quot;travel friendly&quot; size. I use this camera for backpacking both in the Mountains of Colorado and though Europe. As long as you are not looking for a megazoom, this camera is Great. The articulated screen is great for unique angles as well as self Portraits. I love how adjustable everything is on this camera, You have compete control over ISO and shutter speed to get exactly the shot you desire. Even if you don&apos;t know everything about photography, there are many preset modes that will give you great results. This camera will not let you down! ...</Review>

     <Review>I take this camera when I don&apos;t want to haul my heavy DSLR. it has all the manual controls and an excellent auto function when you just want that. The quality is excellent. I&apos;ve taken some of my best photos with these Canon G series cameras. The swivel LCD screen lets you get up down and at odd angles for interesting shots. The wide angle lens is excellent for landscapes and cityscapes traveling and for family groups and activities. Controls are well placed. It&apos;s not small enough for pocket or purse but good for tote bag, briefcase, backpack or just carrying.</Review>

     <Review>I was looking for a smaller sized camera as it is not always easy to grab an DSLR with multiple lenses. And I needed a small camera for tight places, i.e. airplane cockpits. G12 fit the bill...RAW files, 720P video, articulated LCD finder, manual control, stabilized 24-140 equivalent lens. However rear control wheel for selecting functions can be very touchy.</Review>

     <Review>I purchased the G12 to use as a point and shoot for travel, holidays and birthdays. There are so many times that I need a camera, but I do not want to carry around my DSLR. I don&apos;t know how often you experience this, but when I pull out my DSLR, especially when its attached to a 70-200 f/2.8, people around me often say wow, look at that camera. In my attempt to avoid the attention and save my neck from carrying all the weight, I decided to purchase my first point and shoot. I know that photography is about compromise, but I was less willing to compromise, image quality, build, and handling as little as possible, while I was more willing to compromise overall size. First, the image quality is about the best you can get from a sensor of this size and the ability to shoot RAW allows you to g ... et even more out of your files. The camera feels solid in my hands without being too small for me to work the controls. I also generally prefer buttons over menu based controls. I didn&apos;t think I would care about the articulated screen, but as it turns out, it became one of my favorite features. Yes, its a little larger than some other compacts and almost as large as some m4/3 cameras with prime lens attached, but if I wanted an interchangeable lens camera I would just use m DSLR, it has better image quality anyway. I once has a cell phone that was so small that it was almost unusable because it was so difficult to hold and push the buttons. The G12 is not like that, it feels just right.

     <Review>Pros: It&apos;s handy; it&apos;s sturdy and can do it all

Cons: Lack of printed manual

The G12 is a very high-end an excellent Point and Shoot camera closer to D-SLR with flexible settings. It has all the features and benefits, I am looking for. I had bought a Canon Rebel but sold it as it was a bit too big for my taste and needs. Canon could have provided a written manual for the G12 but I found it easy enough to print the 212 page manual from the canon software on my own printer. I also bought a telephoto lens and adapter for filters as well; I feel I have it all without spending it all. The Canon S95 was a bit small for my handling.</Review>

     <Review>I shot rangefinder Leica&apos;s for years, upgraded(?) to a 5D with good results but am currently blown away by the G12. Portability = useability, bottomline. The easily accessible exposure compensation dial is one of the features that enables images to be created in camera not in post with software. The essence of photography!The &apos;miniature effect&apos; creates a horizontal or vertical focal plane which, once again, lets me create shallow depth of field, ala my f1.4 Leica lens, in camera. My favorite use of the G12, bar none, is the macro function. IT IS STUNNING! Flowers are prolific where I live and just by by chance and boredom one day I shot some tiny blooms and was absolutely shocked by the detail I saw when I viewed the images on my computer. The image stabilization plus the flip out LCD view ... finder makes handheld macro captures fairly easy with killer results. The only negative I&apos;ve experienced so far is the lens cover blades began sticking halfway open and eventually I just removed them, got a semi-retro looking snap-over leather case and all is well now.

     <Review>Pros: Long battery life, fast, tactile body, affordable, and takes great pictures.

Cons: Not enough optical zoom for the money: only 5x

Love the G12. This is the 3rd Canon digital that I&apos;ve purchased. I like the large LCD screen and the viewfinder. Too bad Canon is not putting the viewfinder on all of their cameras. In South Florida, it&apos;s not easy to see what you&apos;re photographing with the LCD screen only.
Feels like an old 35mm camera. Not heavy; lithium ion battery lasts a long time without recharging. Little to no lag time between shots. Still learning what everything does.</Review>

     <Review>I am an amateur photographer and recently aquired the G12 to use when I need to avoid the hassle of carrying all my bulky DSLR equipment around. I love the versatality of the G12, it offers me all the functions of my Canon 40D (and more)without the bulk. The swivel screen is a fantastic addition and very useful to capture images from obscure and interesting angles. The disadvantage of the small size is the proximity of all the controls to each other and the consequent tendency to press the wrong buttons. I find the carry strap annoying as it keeps swinging in the way. All in all, I can highly recommend this fine camera as a useful tool, for those moments when carrying your bulky DSLR and lenses is not feasible.</Review>

     <Review>I purchased this camera because I was looking for a p&amp;s that would take high quality images to rival a 40D with the 28-135 kit lens. This camera does a good job to that end. Ergonomically and functionally the camera is consistent with the Canon dSLR line. The index finger wheel and thumb-wheel are completely customizable, which allows the user complete control over the exposure settings. Additionally there is a programmable short-cut button, which allows even more control. The ISO control knob is nice, as is the exposure control knob. Noise at high ISO (greater than 1000) is an issue, but nothing a good NR plug-in cannot fix. I was unable to open G12 RAW images with Adobe Photoshop CS4; Adobe Camera RAW v6.2 is only compatible with CS5 (NOT CS4, CS3, etc.). The bundled Canon so ... ftware works fine for this and there are other work-arounds (like Adobe&apos;s free RAW-to-DNG converter). In terms of video it does 720p 24fps. The downside is that the focal length available is limited by the focal length at the start of the video capture. For example, if you start at 3x zoom, you may zoom in to 5x (and have all the digital zoom available), but you will not be able to go any wider than the original 3x. Also once you lock focus in video and start recording - that focus cannot be changed after the fact. There is no manual focus in video mode. In short no one will use this as a very serious video camera, but video itself is of good quality. The camera has many bells &amp; whistles like Miniature mode (faux tilt-shift); HDR (built-in); Fish-eye lens effect; ect. These things are neat, but seem to be intended for the consumer market. The lens is sharp, but not fast (f/2.8-f/4.5). At the end of the day the camera takes very nice images and video. It&apos;s light, but still a little bulky for most pockets. I carry it whenever I&apos;m not carrying my regular bag. The battery life is good and hasn&apos;t been an issue in the two weeks I&apos;ve used it.

     <Review>I am a professional photographer and use the best Canon L lenses and bodies made. That said, sometimes I want something that is much smaller and fun. A camera that takes great images, let&apos;s me shoot auto or manual and is pocket size. I find I get great photos I would normally miss because I actually have the camera on my person. The G12 is an amazing little camera. Not as small as some point and shoots but still pocket sized. Very sharp images, very good in low light, excellent focus, shoots RAW, has an adjustable flash which is a HUGE benefit, Great battery life. Macro is decent. Accurate metering. I do not like the flash when shooting wide angle closer than 4 feet because the coverage is a bit narrowly focused and creates a vignette. I also do not like the flash unless it is diale ... d back -1 to -1.3 as it tends to blow out faces shot close up in a dark room. But once dialed back, the images are perfect. That said, buy this camera. You will see a lot of pros using this one on their vacation.

     <Review>The thing that sold me on this over s95 was the control dial in front for aperture and the range finder like top dials. I have had point and shoots where I had to scroll through the screen menu to change settings and swore I would not go through that again. Yes, you can&apos;t slip into your pocket. Reviews touting its control of DOF is what ultimately set the hook. Range of zoom seems pretty nice and the camera response is pretty good as well. The macro on this camera is really quite nice. Images seem pretty detail rich. If this is any indication of lens quality, I would have to say it&apos;s at least as good as the better non-L lenses. The one thing I would caution, is to keep your ISO around 400 if possible. Getting up towards 800 you introduce noise to the point that you are reminded, oh yeah ... , a point and shoot camera. The fact that the top dial has 1/3 stop increments is a really nice feature and does let you control noise. Coupled with the front dial aperture control makes for a nice quick little camera. Lag time not withstanding. Seems inherent in the P&amp;S range of cameras. I like the swing out screen and have found it useful for shooting in awkward and cramped situations. The screen itself seems more prone to fingerprints that are not easy to remove. Overall camera build seems quite good. I like it&apos;s weight and it actually feels pretty sturdy for its size. For me, this camera will not replace packing your SLR for an important shoot. It is a convenient and powerful little AIO camera that can create some great images. Canon has done a great job of putting the features that are most important right up on top, and ready to go. Nice One!

     <Review>Canon continues to improve the G1x line with the G12. I bought this for my wife for as a present and was tempted to keep it for myself. It is small, relatively light-weight, compared to a DSLR, but packed with features, and a solid feel in your hands. It takes great pictures just using the Program mode, which I am sure will get better using non-auto and RAW captures. Now I know why most pros have one of these so they always have a good camera handy. The only complaint I have is that Canon does not included a printed manual. I had to print one off of the CD for my wife. However, I did get her the G12 cheatsheet from PhotoBert - also great products.</Review>

     <Review>Needed a small camera will maximum features and photo quality. I&apos;m a Nikon pro but prefer the performance of the Canon P&amp;S cameras. battery life in my opinion is a bit short but with flash using the same battery,,,you can expect only so much from the size &amp; technology. The size allows for more unobtrusive people photography and portability especially when I don&apos;t want to tote around a pro camera all day. Can&apos;t beat the features &amp; photo quality for the price in my opinion.</Review>

     <Review>Camera is good. Rock-solid body. Very clean images, simple, intuitive interface. Quick to pull out and shoot with. Biggest con is that the flash only has low, medium, and high power - I&apos;d like to be able to set flash settings in EV +/- steps just like exposure. I still can&apos;t seem to get the flash to expose correctly as a result. The RAW format has changed again, and consequently, doesn&apos;t work with Photoshop RAW or Adobe DNG converter. Those should be updating soon to accommodate, but for how, I&apos;m stuck using Canon&apos;s slow less-good DPP software to edit the RAW files.</Review>

     <Review>use the product as a pocket take everywhere camera the menus and the scene variations are so much fun to use. the camera was surprisingly fast and generally flexible. the i.s. is great. have had early power shot cameras (not the g series) and for me this is worth the difference. the articulated screen is useful for sneaky shots. the raw files and the choice jpg images are fabulous as well. love this camera. if this camera came with a bigger sensor oh boy. large blowups are not as good as aps/full frame as to be expected.</Review>

     <Review>Pros: Fast/accurate auto-focus; Good Image Stabilization; Good Image Quality; Large Clear LCD; Good in Low Light

This is the 2nd G12 I have owned. Image quality is unsurpassed and you have complete and easily accessible control over most features of the camera which are to numerous to mention. While it won&apos;t fit in a shirt or jeans pocket it fits quite easily in my cargo shorts pockets and I carry it with me most of the time I don&apos;t want to lug by 7D DSLR around. I lose little in image quality between the two cameras.</Review>

     <Review>I have been photographing for many years as both professional and enthusiast with Leica&apos;s, Hasselblad&apos;s and Nikon&apos;s, and I am continually amazed at the image quality from the Canon G12, even from its jpegs (RAW is very impressive). I typically photograph with both formats, jpg and RAW, and save times are typically three seconds at most--not inconvenient but not instant either. Startup is very fast with the G12, AF is accurate, and the close-up capabilities are crisply impressive at wide-angle. Lens flare is virtually non-existent, image contrast is very high, sharpness is excellent, noise is extremely well controlled, and chromatic aberrations are hard to find (and easily corrected with software). I&apos;d previously owned a G9, which was notable, but the G12 blows it away. I&apos;ve also owned the ... Panasonic ZS7, which the G12 leaves in the dust, and own an Olympus E-P2, which G12 images compare favorably with although not as detailed. Even when printing at 13 x 18 inches the G12 results are surprisingly nuanced and detailed with little or no noise (ISO 80-200). Needless to say, I&apos;m very happy with the results. I think it&apos;s Canon best G series to date.MOVIES: AF (continuous), AE Lock, and Exposure Compensation ARE NOT AVAILABLE in movie mode! In other words whichever focus point you began with when you started shooting is exactly where the camera will remain for the remainder of that video. No, you can&apos;t begin with a close-up and then shift to focus on something far. The AF won&apos;t work. Which is dumb. A huge disappointment from Canon for those interested in video! I hope they fix this with a firmware update.SOFTWARE: The included Canon Digital Photo Professional software does a great job of converting RAW files into 16-bit or 8-bit Tiff, including manipulating the parameters for Unsharp Mask, and notates the RAW file so that your settings can be recalled when re-opened. It also lets you adjust White Balance, Contrast, Tone Curve, Saturation, Sharpness, Noise, Crop, etc. While it doesn&apos;t have the finesse of controls in Adobe Camera Raw (Adobe Bridge) it does a very good job, including Batch processing. HANDLING: I found the handling and heft of the Canon G12 to be very comfortable, especially in using the swivel-tilt LCD screen (which is very sharp, by the way). The knurled ring on the front just below the shutter/zoom button (which allows you to adjust shutter speed of aperture, depending on Mode) is very useful, although I times I found it too easy to mistake it for the zoom control.Infrequently I found myself wishing that the zoom range was a bit longer, perhaps 28 to 200mm. But realistically I think Canon&apos;s decision to limit the zoom range to 28-140mm (more than enough for most situations) is probably one of the factors that makes the lens such an outstanding performer. The Canon G12 is a great little camera that tries to compete with Micro Four Thirds and blows point-and-shoots out of the water.

     <Review>I bought this camera as an upgrade to a canon g10 that I was super happy with for the past two years but wanted better low light performance. This camera definitely delivered in that respect. Where I was only able to shoot at iso400 before I can now fully utilize 800 and even 1600 (with expected noise) for ambient light images. I&apos;m really impressed with the image quality as well. My only issues thus far are that focusing on distant landscapes at infinity is no where near as fast as the g10. The camera will give you a yellow box warning stating that it can&apos;t focus even in mid day light. It requires you to find something contrasty on the horizon to focus on before recomposing to shoot. I&apos;ve been quite disappointed with this as well as close up macro focusing. Just not as fast as previous mod ... el. My second issue is that the new screen on the back is bulky and takes up precious hand grip area... I prefered the flush mount screen of the g10. Overall the quality if the images outweigh the quirks. This is an awesome camera to surest into your pocket or throw into a slr camera bag as a backup.

     <Review>I replaced my Canon G9 with the new G12. I had purchased an aftermarket knurled grip for the G9, and I am happy that Canon devised a better finger grip for the newer series. I love the rugged feel of the frame around the swing out screen. Seems rugged. So many of the features are so familiar to me from the older G series that I am right at home. The facial recognition is nice for party pix. The slow-sync shutter creates much more natural lighting for flash photography. This is still my favorite camera, though I have a truly pocket-size S90 as well as a 30D and 50D as my SLR&apos;s. You won&apos;t be disappointed with the G12, unless you are looking for something to fit in your pocket instead of your cargo pants.</Review>

     <Review>The new G12 is a great point and shoot and although my main camera is a 1D, this is small enough for me to carry everywhere without putting my back out. The large flip out screen is something i never thought I&apos;d use, but am now using all the time. I&apos;m so used to looking through a viewfinder that it took a little getting used to but is great allowing high and low shots with ease and big enough to see everything clearly. All the presets are easy to use and the miniature effect is already a favorite. The low light function works well and all the dials using it in manual setting are great. That said manual focus option is extremely fiddly and annoying to use and takes forever to get the right focus. Would be great to have a ring focus on the viewfinder but this wouldn&apos;t be for everyone. ... I&apos;m also having a lot of trouble importing the RAW files into my computer even with the provided software...i&apos;m sure it&apos;s a mac thing and everything will catch up sooner or later. Other than that a very happy customer! Keep up the good work.

     <Review>I am a photographer, but don&apos;t want to carry my 5D to the zoo and ball games!! This is great to leave in my purse. Takes wonderful, spontaneous photos, even on Auto. Focus is incredible! I&apos;m getting a little spoiled by it in fact. Downsides? Viewfinder is poor. Shot in RAW and could&apos;nt open the files in Bridge. Contacted Canon and they said there wasn&apos;t an update for the RAW files yet and I would have to open those in their software... which I don&apos;t llike. Also, recycle time is a little slow, maybe not as much if you use the viewfinder and not the screen.</Review>

     <Review>Overall, I think the G12 is a nice camera. My last Canon G-Series was a G2, which I really liked. Since the G2, I&apos;ve mainly use Panasonic FZ series digital compacts, because of the high-quality Leica lenses, the zoom range, the ability to achieve focus quickly, and the intuitive controls. I made the switch to the G12 because I wanted better quality from high-ISO images, decent manual controls, and the capability to take HD movies. The good??? The camera produces very nice images that I have no doubt will allow printing up to 12x18 at near the quality of my D300. The images at ISO 100 and 200 are very clean, and ISO 400 is completely usable. The lens has a little bit of distortion (mainly at the wide end), but it is very sharp. Also, the zoom range is fairly decent. The camera feel ... s nice in-hand, and has all of the main controls very accessible.The bad??? My main gripe has to do with the build quality and the price. The build quality is definitely nice, but it doesn&apos;t feel as nice as what a [$] compact should provide. It really should have an all metal body in this price range (only the front plate is metal). Also, some of the dials feel a little cheap. The other gripe has to do with the controls. As you adjust aperture/shutter speed/ISO/etc., the camera feels a bit sluggish to respond. It&apos;s not as fast as my 2 year old Panasonic. It&apos;s also not a speed demon when it comes to focusing. It takes about ?? to 1 sec to focus in good light. It&apos;s not bad, but I was hoping for closer to DSLR-speed for a high-end compact camera in the $500 price range. The battery charge indicator isn&apos;t very useful ??? it goes from full charge (three bars) to dead in about 10 minutes of actual use. However, this syndrome is pretty common with digital compacts. The tripod hole is not centered with lens axis. Lastly, the optical finder is almost useless.Sorry, no ugly??? it&apos;s a good looking camera with very intuitive controls.Because of the build quality and the sluggish controls, I&apos;m left just a bit disappointed. I would probably be satisfied had I only paid $400 for this camera. Despite this, I will still enjoy the nice images that can be produced using this camera.

     <Review>I was surprised by the high quality of the photo this portable camera took. There is a lot of manual functions help me to achieve the DSLR can do. The size is little bigger than small pokcet camera. The video is OK and there is no autofocus during zooming.</Review>

     <Review>Pros: Good in Low Light; Easy To Use; Good Image Stabilization; Small / Compact

I had been searching for a camera whose screen could be tilted 360 degree. Onlly SX40 and G12 fitted by budget and POINT-and-Shoot category.

I loved the antique look and chose G12 and am really happy with the product I chose.

I am merely a casual photographer and the only cons I have seen in last 2 weeks is, in AUTO mode, the FLASH comes on even in evening light. You have to manually switch-off the flash if you&apos;d like to capture an instant in evening light.</Review>

     <Review>I travel quite frequently and always have trouble packing my DSLR. The Canon G12 is perfect for on the go photo and video. And it fits easily inside my carry on bag. I prefer this over the Canon S95 because it have more external controls which makes it easier to change settings between shots.</Review>

     <Review>I bought this for a first time trip to South Africa. It takes beautiful pictures, stunning HD videos and is so simple to use! I guess there are people who like to fool with manual adjustments. But on auto my shots came out great. I should have purchased a telephoto lens with it, maybe a 24x. The 5x is OK but is not OK for distance shots. My fault, not the camera&apos;s. I got an additional battery pack which was smart and took three 8 gig cards. Check out the videos at hwh1946. Lots of bumps from the RangeRover and the wind. But check out the quality of the film.</Review>

     <Review>Being a previous PowerShot (A640) owner, I want several features on my camera. Thankfully Canon kept the viewfinder and the Screen that can be manipulated 180 degrees (this really protects the screen from scratches when not in use and also allows me to see shots at angles I normally would have had to shoot blindly.) The feature they got rid of, to my great disappointment, was the ability to use alkaline batteries. I never had to worry about not having charged batteries as the AA batteries were available wherever I was at. I also do not like that the auto shoot buttons (such as the portrait, action, nighttime, etc) are now embedded in menus - Yuck! The camera is slightly heavy, but more than easy to hold on to. I wish I could use my lenses from my Cannon EOS 7E on it - maybe they can ... do something about that! The lag time was surprisingly long. I expected a much shorter lag time for the money spent and the time since my last PowerShot camera. Overall, it is a nice camera. It is way to overpriced! My husband bought it for Christmas. I would not have spent that money for the camera.

     <Review>Pros: Photo and video quality

Cons: Wide range of features can be more complex to learn

The G12 takes much better quality photos than my older G7. The weight is the same, but it comes with much improved features. I also like the rotating screen on the back. It allows much better shooting angles in akward situations, such as wanting to shoot pictures of a child on the floor without getting down on your knees. The G12 is much better at handling shifting light conditions when making digital video clips as you pan across. It is an excellent camera for the advanced amateur / enthusiast. It does have a point and shoot mode, but the G12 is not a point and shoot camera.</Review>

     <Review>This isn&apos;t a point and shoot and this isn&apos;t a DSLR. If you are comfortable with both those styles, don&apos;t assume you&apos;ll jump right into this camera without a learning curve. To shoot RAW, you have to shoot in non-auto modes. I love shooting in manual with my SLRs so I immediately tried to do that. I had a difficult time getting the exposure I wanted both with &amp; without flash at first. The photos (once I got more used to the camera) look FANTASTIC and I&apos;m excited to have RAW shooting capabilities in a smaller camera. I look forward to taking this on my vacation instead of my SLR later this month. I love that you have dials on the outside of camera to control manual functions. The camera is a little bigger/bulkier than I expected. It&apos;s not quite a pocket camera, but rather a camera that ... would fit in a backpack, purse, or drawstring bag on a vacation. (fannie-pack anyone?)

     <Review>This is my carry around everywhere camera for when I don&apos;t feel like lugging around the 5dmk2 and accessories. Though not a shirt pocket camera (at least my shirt pockets) it&apos;s small enough to fit in a jacket pocket or small bag on my belt. Takes great pictures, I can still shoot in Raw, and I can control most of what I need to quickly without having to search through menus to find everything. All the controls are right up top or on the back. The swivel lcd is bright and clear and is great for taking those low or high shots. So far I haven&apos;t found anything I don&apos;t like about the camera. Another good feature is you can get a filter adapter made by Canon that works really well with 58mm filters (love my polarizer!) and isn&apos;t too expensive.</Review>

The pictures are great quality. The pop out screen is the best feature. This is my vacation camera instead of my 7D.</Review>

     <Review>Pros: Quiet; Tilt /Swivel LCD; Good Image Quality; Small and capable; Easy To Use

I have a number of DSLRs that are too big to carry on vacations and trips, and my point and shoot doesnt have any real control. The G12 has reasonable megapixel count, handles well, is big enough but not too big and provides manual control. The viewfinder is great for bright sunlight and the tilting display lets you hold the camera high or low. The quality of the photos is good and depends on your skill and care. I would prefer a bit more control over the auto focus and exposure modes, but it does well enough on its own. I guess I really wanted a $1000 camera for [$]. I bought a belt pack case for it and it goes with me just about everywhere now and my wife took the old point and shoot.</Review>

     <Review>Great little pocket camera. I have a Canon 5D Mark II, but wanted something a little easier to transport in my carry on luggage for business trips. I took it with me on a trip last week, and it worked great. I really like the ability to manually control the shutter/aperture/iso, etc using the dials on the camera versus drilling through menus. The screen is nice and sharp, and the pictures look great. To be honest, it&apos;s a little large for pocket camera, but compared to the 5D, it&apos;s tiny. I didn&apos;t want to trade image quality for size, and this camera gives me the best of both.</Review>

     <Review>I have 3 dSLR cameras (5DmkII, T2i, and XTi), as well as a G9. The G12 can&apos;t match my dSLRs, but does come pretty darn close to the XTi, and blows the G9 away! I love the HDR feature (takes 3 exposures and merges them in-camera). 720p video is also a plus (but not necessary). In general, the image quality is excellent for a point-and-shoot. And with a built-in hot-shoe, I can still use it with speedlights and strobes, all with a much faster x-sync speed as well. Again, my preference is to shoot with my 5DmkII or T2i, but when I don&apos;t feel like lugging this gear around, the G12 fits the bill well. A purchase I don&apos;t regret.</Review>

     <Review>This is my second powershot camera. This model is a big ungrade for my general use. I need and use the water proof case for underwater pics and for rain/wet condition pictures. I have not played with all the bells and whistles, but am most happy with the LCD screen visibility, even with sunglasses and in the case. For the money spent, the pics and videos using the zoom or not are very good quality. I plan on many years with this camera.</Review>

     <Review>Pros: Amazing pictures in a smaller than DSLR package.

Cons: S95 is almost same camera in much more reduced size.

I really liked the G12 but returned it. Just too big for what you get. I like the lense but there are better lenses out there in this size range. And I like the pictures but the S95 is almost as good and it&apos;s almost 3 times smaller.

Check out the S95 if you get a G12. You will be envious of the small size that fits in a pocket and attracts a lot less attention when taking discrete pictures. I like taking pictures of people at parties and get togethers, and when we are at work even. The S95 is the same camera as the G12, with a smaller lense and a much smaller footprint and it makes a lot more sense for most people.

Unless you are a reporter and usual ... ly want to carry a DSLR but can&apos;t in some circumstances I think the S95 makes more sense for 90% of people in average circumstances. I put a small aftermarket handle on the front of my S95 (ala G12 grip) and it really makes the S95 a grabbable package that can be just as nice to use as the G12.

The lense on the s95 is slower than on the G12 but not by much. I have not given up much to have a camera that can walk around with me every day, instead of when I remember to bring it. And I take a lot more pictures now. I never use my phone for video or stills any more; was never really happy with it&apos;s lack of zoom or it&apos;s speed. With S95, it&apos;s never an issue. I can zoom on license plates, or ID things with the digital zoom I can&apos;t see with naked eye. That&apos;s really a lot of power in or pocket..

DSLR is nice but it will sit around the house most of the time and not get used. Pocket cameras are the wave of the future and the 95 is a great example of low light capabilities and size in a powerful small package.

     <Review>Pros: Fast/accurate auto-focus; Good Image Stabilization; Large Clear LCD; Good Image Quality; Easy To Use

The Canon G12 is a great general purpose camera.
It&apos;s been an arms length away from me ever since I got it 
and I even pack it along with my pro gear when I want to get out and do some serious shooting. I love to use the articulating screen for photographing from unusual angles. The hot-shoe is a big plus and all the essential controls are at you fingertips. 
Highly recommended!</Review>

     <Review>We purchased two G12s for a hiking trip in Europe as our 5D Mark IIs would be rather heavy. They are brilliant little cameras with pro controls which feel right at home. We went to [...] to compare the G12 with the S95 and the choice was a no-brainer. While the S95 might be the perfect pocket camera, the G12 feels like the REAL cameras we&apos;re used to. The 10mp sensor delivers wonderful photos and video. I&apos;ve been intrigued with the Canon G-series cameras for years but never bought one until now. Great decision!</Review>

I love the Manual settings, shooting in RAW mode and the exposure settings. The camera is stout, well made and the video is decent.Here&apos;s some photos and video from the Canon G12:[@]</Review>

     <Review>I have owned a compact digital camera for about eight years now and have been looking for something new for a while. There&apos;s nothing wrong with my old camera, but I wanted something with more options for controlling the photos I take. I settled on the G12 because it has the features I want, but isn&apos;t a SLR, which I don&apos;t need at the moment. I use the camera at social gatherings and sporting events. I&apos;m also a teacher and plan on using it with my classroom from time to time. What I like about the camera: -The basic functions make taking decent photos pretty simple. Even in manual mode, you can push a single button to set aperture and shutter speed quickly. I find that you can easily switch between full control and letting the camera do of the work. What&apos;s good -I like that the scree ... n is on a pivot and swivel. I can see what I&apos;m taking a picture of a more easily than if were stationary. Also, I can protect the screen when the camera is not in use. -As much as some complain that a viewfinder on a digital camera is redundant, but I like the idea of composing a photo without the need for all the bells and whistles. What&apos;s bad -I&apos;m a little old school when it comes to my camera. My first SLR was older than I am and I used it up until just a few years ago. I resisted the automatic camera age because I wanted to do things myself. All of the bells an whistles on this camera can be a little daunting. That being said, I wanted bells and whistles, so this can&apos;t be much of a complaint. -It came with a neck strap, but not a wrist strap. I had to purchase a wrist strap separately. All and all, I&apos;m very happy with my new camera and look forward to using it for 1000s of great photos.

     <Review>I chose this camera for those situations where my Nikon D700 was too cumbersome to lug around. The viewfinder was essential and from reviews I assumed the camera had no major problems. Well, the viewfinder is useless with about 70% coverage that is shifted to the right (image shifted right). The shutter lag is just enough that you can&apos;t catch quick expressions. In my work I often photograph people being interviewed, usually during the setup and breaks. With my D700 and even my old Canon 40D I am able to catch pauses between sentences and pretty much the expressions I see. The G12 is always late, with prefocus, manual focus, etc. It is just late enough that you can&apos;t catch any quick expression. The same goes for movement. Forget about any decisive moment photography unless the mome ... nt waits for the G12. Unless I am missing something, there is no way to lock the focus in manual when the LCD is closed. Even with the LCD open it is awkward to prefocus and lock focus. The Program mode plus Auto Iso could have been a great feature but it is programed to jack the shutter speed and ISO up and use a large f-stop even in bright daylight. The image quality poor at any but the lowest ISO settings. Noise is substantial at ISO 400. Barrel distortion at 28mm is unacceptable and requires post processing if you want your photos to look at all professional. Of the many disappointments the poor viewfinder and the shutter lag make the camera near useless for anything but snapshots.

     <Review>I haven&apos;t Made any large prints from the files yet so i cannot speak to the IQ per se. I have been using the camera to take many shots i will use as texture layers. If you have used Canon point and shoots before the controls are mostly obvious. I am a Nikon DSLR shooter so if you havent used a canon there may be a little learning curve. My initial impression is as expected this is not a DSLR substitue but for those times when a lot of kit will not work it does the job better than no camera at all. One hassle compared to my S90 is that it will not fit in a pocket unless you have an exceptionally large one or cargo pants.</Review>

     <ReviewTitle>Extreme upgrade - spectacular photos</ReviewTitle>

     <Review>Yes, I know I can get this camera for seventy dollars less all over the internet as well as at the local big bix stores. But with 6 value pays, it just made it a little easier to capture spectacular pictures. The camera starts up lightning quick, plus the photo quality is 100 x&apos;s better than the top of the line Panasonic point &amp; shoot. The trade off is weight, plus this won&apos;t fit into my pocket. But the photo&apos;s, the photo&apos;s!
There are a ton of features on this camera and will take some time to master. that&apos;s for sure.
Expensive for a point and shoot camera, but it&apos;s buily like a tank. I am ready (wife too) to take the photography to a new level....(for us anyway).</Review>

     <Review>Since i have the g10, there wasn&apos;t much of a learning curve, but every time i turn this camera on, i go wow. the color is simply outstanding. much better than the g10 in my opinion. i love the swivel screen, the features are fun to play with and use. love the scenes and the HD video is good. i have nothing to compare it to. used it several times and again wow. i bought this over the olympus zx-1 because it had a view finder and the swivel screen (great for hard angles). i&apos;m not retiring my dSLRs, but i am comfortable taking only this camera on vacation and with me every day. oh the battery life is the best i&apos;ve ever seen in a compact.</Review>

     <Review>Pros: Rotating screen, viewfinder, build quailiy, excellent photo quality

Cons: Nothing

I just bought the camera but have taken many many photos in all different settings. Indoor, outdoor, macro, beach, action, with flash, without flash, etc and all I can say is the camera is awesome !
I had a Canon G 9 and when that broke (after taken a zillion photos) I bought a G10 which I thought was awful in picture quality. Even exchanged it thinking the camera might be defective but the second was just as bad. Awful ! I did not touch the G 11 and figured I try the G12 and I am glad I did. I am thrilled with the camera. I am thrilled.
The camera has a unique feature set that I knew I wanted. First was the vari angle rotating LCD screen. Great for taken low and high shots that you ... might miss. You position the camera, not yourself and then turn, rotate or flip the screen up or down to you. By being able to also flip it , it is a breeze for taken self portraits as you can see yourself.
The camera has a decent zoom but because the lens is so sharp, you take a picture and then enlarge and crop in on the subject in post production without a big loss in picture quality. I was very impressed with the results !
The design and the controls are retro and I love the ease of changing key settings without going in to hidden menus. On the camera are roatating dials that you turn to change settings, like for ISO, etc.
I am very happy with the ISO settings as this camera has more to choose from. For example, most cameras have 100 ISO, then 200 ISO, etc This camera has incremental ISO settings, so you can go from 100 ISO to 125 ISO, to 150 ISO, etc .and the way up. The manual settings are great, such as aperture settings, shutter speed, exposure compensation, etc.
The next feature I love is the viewfinder. It has a dioptic adjustment to use for your own eyesight so the images are clear, even if you wanted to use it without your glasses on. You turn the dial near the finder until the image is in focus.
In bright sunny light and screens get washed out you always have the viewfinder. ...

     <Review>I&apos;m an avid photographer. Overall, I&apos;m very happy with the G12. Nice compact size with a lot of features. Full battery charge lasts a long time. Autofocus sometimes takes a while to focus on the subject. When taking multiple shots with flash it takes time for the flash to recharge before you can take a shot. Zoom quality of the picture taken - too grainy.</Review>

     <Review>I use this camera to document my artwork. I am an installation artist requiring professional standard documentation of my work, and although I am only an amature photographer, I find the shots taken with thus camera to be of a very high standard. I mostly use it on Manual setting, without the flash, and with professional lighting indoors. I love how the LCD screen can swivel, and I can attach a magnifying lens if I want to, a great feature. I&apos;ve only had a few weeks, so I haven&apos;t had much of a chance to fully experience it all yet, but I think the battery may run out a little quick. (or it may not have been on full charge when I got it out of the box?) other than that, great product, nice and light to carry, perfect for travel, excellent quality photos.</Review>

     <Review>Pros: Beautiful camera, a super nice upgrade from G2. I feel guilty about spending so much on myself.

Cons: a) Price
b) NO manual 9who wants to print out a 200+ page PDF

1)Surprised how small the camera is I thought it would be larger.
2) Newegg packing is disgraceful. A handful of peanuts - No bubble wrap to protect a $500 camera. I have had $50 hard drives wrapped better in bubble wrap.
3) Confusion on which accessories I need, lens bellows,UV lens, lens cap? Not much information available.</Review>

     <Review>Pros: I had a G6 and then replaced it with a G7 which finally died a months ago. I don&apos;t use most of the manual settings (I bought the G6 hoping to learn them but lost interest). I decided to save some money and get a good camera with out all the bells and whistles so I bought a Nikon Coolpix 8100. It didn&apos;t even compare. It was slow and took alot of blurry pictures. The detail just wasn&apos;t there when you zoomed in on a picture. I want a good camera and use it for family pictures and edit with Photoshop. However most of the time I just have it set to Auto. I RMAed the Nikon and got a G12. This thing is amazing. It is extremely fast at start up and taking shots. I love how it auto selects the picture type (macro, portrait, etc). I know it does a million manual things that I don&apos;t ... use but it&apos;s worth the price to have it take amazing shots on auto

Cons: It&apos;s not small or light. In fact it&apos;s bigger and heavier than my G7 was. It&apos;s not cheap.

This is about as good as it gets with out a bulky expensive SLR. Considering that it is a great value. I love the flip our screen. (something that went away on the G6). This is an awesome camera that I would reccomend to anyone whether they want to shoot manually or just leave it on auto.

     <Review>I was looking for an upgrade in a camera but still dreading the weight and price for a DSLR camera with exchangeable lens. Aiming to venture in some manual shots but mostly using the preset preferences. Picture quality, video quality and easy of use are GREAT. Easy to carry. Even fit a large pocket in a coat or jacket. Recommend it.</Review>

     <Review>I am not a professional photographer but I am arts professional and I need very good quality images of my work. This camera replaces a whole range of cameras I used to have which were stolen all in one go. I had considered getting a new slr but in the end decided that a very flexible point and shoot would be more my line. I am able to make excellent quality reproductions of my work with the G12, and already am experiencing the benefits of its flexibility and great image quality. My only complaint is that the manuel that comes with the camera is only very simple, covering only the most immediate operation. The rest of the manual is on a disk which one must sit in front of the computer to read. There are many functions on this camera which I probably wont ever use, or which I have to e ... valuate the correct situation in which to use them. But I think this camera is a wonderful solution for someone who has my needs of a camera, great quality, lightweight and with a good intermediate lens. If I want a better zoom or a wider angle I will get into an slr again, but meantime it is great to have a really good camera that I can carry around easily.

     <Review>Because of this camera&apos;s size it is not as intimidating as lugging around a big DSLR with a large lens. The photos you can capture with this camera are amazing!! I read all the comments on this camera before purchase it and was worried if I was really going to be happy due to a few of the negative comments by professional &amp; semi-professional photographers. It&apos;s a learning curve, especially if you want to use all the manual settings like I have done. Many times I wanted to put the G12 down and grab my big camera because I knew it was going to be faster for me because the G12 controls were different to me. I love it!! I am happy with the quality of the image and cannot wait to purchase the waterproof housing!! It truly is an amazing small camera but it&apos;s going to be different than your l ... arger camera, just give yourself the time to play around with it!!

     <Review>I am currently filming a documentary in Eastern Europe. The film crew have all their prosumer gear but have been amazed at how well the G12 records video. We will be using footage from the G12 for the final edits. We are also writing an editorial for a magazine. The G12 is going to be a solid contributor as the ease of cary means it always on hand to shoot a professional RAW still (or to capture unexpected moving images). The &apos;miniature&apos; setting on film mode allows for some amazing time laps&apos;. The camera start up is quite quick and shooting in auto allows you to get some good &apos;from the hip&apos; holiday snaps. This makes the most of the point and shoot genre, that the G12 falls into. It is however a little bulky for streamlining into your pocket. It fits fine in a jacket or sits well on th ... e neck strap tucked into your sweat shirt. In all, this camera has been perfect for traveling with, shooting stills and moving image at a profesional level.

     <Review>Pros: The camera has a good textured feel, though the controls are a little crowded, the lcd screen is excellent, and the battery life is ok. I do not find it sluggish at all, in fact, it seems very snappy to me. It is capable of taking excellent pictures if you are willing to adjust some settings first. Macro pics with this camera are very good.

Cons: However, for an out of the box point and shoot, I am very dissapointed in the full auto mode. You will need to adjust some things to get good pics in most cases. It wants to raise the iso setting instead of using the flash in indoor settings, which results in a very noisy picture. The camera doesn&apos;t have a superfine compression setting like my older canons have. The neck strap is good, but gets in the way a lot in use. Oh, a b ... ig con for me is NO printed manual. You get a little quick start guide in the box and a pdf manual on the cd. To me, that sucks, especially with all the features this camera has. Canon doesn&apos;t even sell a paper manual, so forget about having it on you as you learn the camera.

If you switch to the P mode you can still use it like it&apos;s in auto mode, but you can change the settings like you want. You need to set the iso change speed to slow, so it will try not to raise the iso setting, and I set the max iso setting to 400. If It would let me I would set it to 200. You can still change the iso speed manually with the dial on the top. I also found the default jpegs a little soft, so I increased the sharpness on mine. I know it sounds like a lot to do, and it is more than I think you should have to do, but after the changes the camera takes excellent pictures, so I will still give it 4 stars. If you plan to leave it on full auto mode, I give it 2 stars. If they fix the auto mode in a firmware update, I would give it 5. Hope this helps.

     <Review>I have a Nikon D90 as my primary camera but I wanted a subcompact to carry with me. I looked at the NikonP7000, but decided afrer reading reviews that the Canon was the camera I wanted. I like the flip out display,the feel of the camera, the HDR feature, easy controls, and all of the DSLR features it has to create quality photos. I made the right decision!</Review>

     <Review>Pros: Video mode-great; Short Lag Time; Fast/accurate auto-focus; Small / Compact; Easy To Use; Good Image Quality; Good in Low Light; Good Image Stabilization; Large Clear LCD; Fast shooting; Fits the hand

Cons: No time lapse

This camera was a replacement for an old Sony digital. Man, were we surprised at how fast the G12 is, and how easy it is to take video. It&apos;s easy to switch between modes, too. It&apos;s a point and shoot if you want that, or you can tweak it just as you like. Best of both worlds. Frankly, I&apos;m amazed how long the battery lasts. A friend of mine who is an award winning photog for The Toledo Blade recommended the G12, and I&apos;m very glad I listened to him. We&apos;re now using it to take all sorts of pictures we never considered before. Can&apos;t wait to take phot ... ography class using the G12.

The G12 is our Christmas present to each other so we used it quite a bit. It&apos;s fast enough that I was able to catch many facial expressions of the kids while they opened their presents. The digital cameras I had in the past, were never fast enough to catch that. I&apos;m really impressed at how it works and all for under five hundred dollars!

Cons: It&apos;s larger than most point-and-shoot cameras.

Set this camera on automatic and it takes great pictures every time. It also offers many features found on single-lens reflex cameras. It shoots beautiful HD video as well. I especially like it&apos;s ability to shoot pictures in low light conditions.</Review>

     <Review>If you don&apos;t want the expense or inconvenience of a dSLR, the PowerShot G12 is the way to go. I&apos;m admittedly just an amateur photographer, but I&apos;ve gotten some stunning photos out of this camera. Portraits and macro shots are really easy to get just right. There&apos;s some noise at higher ISOs (as to be expected), but really great overall. Plus HD Video, RAW + JPEG, and small enough to carry in my bag at all times.</Review>

     <Review>I finally updated my G-2, and now have the G-12. I love the rotating screen on the G-series, so that was the main criterion for buying another G-series Canon. Of course the G-12 has many more cool and handy features as well. I also like the size of this digital camera; it&apos;s larger than the shirt-pocket digitals, but I prefer its substantial feel. I&apos;ll be carrying it around with me much more than my full-size DSLR!</Review>

     <Review>Out of the box the camera appears solid, with external controls, RAW capability and so forth. But the shutter lag exceeds a full second, and you have to first half-depress the shutter to focus before taking your shot. If your subject moves in the interim, the focus tracking option is useless. The flash consistently blows out highlights, and most irritating, the so-called spot focus reveals itself as a large blob in the viewfinder, leaving the shooter unsure just where, if anywhere, the camera is focusing. I hope Canon installs SLR-quality focusing points in its next version, and reduces shutter lag that exceeds Canon&apos;s own $100 pocket cameras. Images above ISO 200 are rather noisy as well. I returned the camera and will stick with my 5D Mark II and D20 for now. It&apos;s more weight, but I can ... trust them.

     <Review>I bought this to replace my G9. I was concerned about noise when shooting above 400 ISO. My research led me to believe Canon had addressed it in the G12, so I gave it a try. So far, I have not been disappointed. I like the full manual features of the camera. I typically like to create my own shots, so I need the control. I also like the option to add a flash. I used a Speedlite 420EX with my G9 and now my G12. I like the power and flexability for creative lighting and how the camera can control the output. I really wanted a camera which can control the shot similar to a SLR. This camera is the best for my price range. The image quality seems better than my G9. So far, I don&apos;t like how the HDR function only works in auto mode and does not allow the user any input as to how the im ... age is made. I feel the HDR images are a little on the bright side. I took a few test shots and in general like the results. If you take images in the early morning or at night, the image exibits more digital noise. Compared to my G9, the dial in the back seems more flimsy. In all, I feel this is the best camera for the money.

     <Review>This is the camera I carry almost everywhere, and that is my style of shooting. I want a camera that has many controlable features as I can get in a pocket camera. This camera though a little larger than most featured point and shoot cameras is the best in class and is more than adequate in most situations. I found the moveable LCD a little ackward at first but have found it very helpful for getting perspective on high or low or around the corner shots.</Review>

     <Review>The G12 is a great camera for serious photographers as well as point-and-shooters. I use it for when I can&apos;t or don&apos;t want to haul my heavy equipment with me; usually on a longer hike. It&apos;s easy to use and takes great shots on auto, but at the same time has all the manual control you could want. Love having the ISO and EV knobs on top. If only they could fit a large sensor in it. Note: Haven&apos;t used it much for video yet as that&apos;s not my thing, so I can&apos;t rate that aspect.</Review>

     <Review>I have a Canon 5d mk II (yeah, it&apos;s old now, but it still works...) and the G12 is no comparison. But, it is awesome in one function, it easily fits many functions, pictures (macro and regular) plus video into an easy to bring along everywhere camera. I like how its screen is movable. Really helps in cramped conditions. Wish my full frame had that feature!</Review>

     <Review>I use this camera for family snapshots, trips to museums with my 2 sons, family vacations, and backyard photos. For my pro work I use Canon 5DmkIII and 7D. Now the G12 is excellent little camera, with lots of features from pro line camera bodies. The image quality is acceptable, but the ISO 400 start to show the noise. I understand that this is small sensor camera and that is not a really cons, I just wanted to mention that. I am happy with this product, my neck does not hurt me carrying around, I like that you can silent/mute the audio noise in the cam. The AF is simple and fine. Finally I can ask some stranger to take a photo of my family with me included!!! I choose g12 over G1x because of the AF and size. I needed simply camera with advanced features.</Review>

     <Review>We owned PowerShot G9. I think that G12 is so much better. By putting a special bottom for over and under exposure it is almost equal to manual exposure control in much simpler way. Canon has put more controls in bottoms instead of menus. It is much quicker to use them when you become use to them. Another example is a second bottom to control speed/exposure. I think it was very wise to lower the megapixels count. The pictures are so much better. I have a Canon 5D Mark II. My wife and I have the G12 to take snapshots of family, mostly flash pictures using the one which is in the camera. G12 makes it possible to take pictures in low light with flash and long exposure so the surroundings can be seen. (It is difficult to do it handheld without a support and the white balance is set on the f ... lash and the lights are usually with warmer colour.) If one can held the camera steady I think is nice. On usually has a lot of pictures of same persons and the most important difference is the different surroundings. My friend is not very keen photographer but wanted to own expensive cameras like the EOS 5D. After my advice he bought G11 and is more satisfied with it than he was with the old EOS 5D. He likes the possibility to take panorama pictures where he can see part of the first picture when he takes the second one. The reason why we bought PhowerShot G9 was the possibility to shoot RAW. The picture from G12 are so much better. It is a camera simple enough for beginners and advanced enough to be a second camera for more advanced photographer or to be a steppingstone towards SLR.

     <Review>The screen is greeat, I like the exposure dial and ISO dial, don&apos;t have to get into the menu to make adjustments. We wanted a camera that still have a view finder, It is just a piece of glass. If you could see the view finder on the back through the eye piece Canon would have a winner. Overall it is better than I expected in shapness, quality and ease of use. Video is ok not as good as my 7D, but for the price this well worth the price</Review>

     <Review>For many the search to find the perfect camera that bridges the gap between the heavy but fully functioning DSLR and the easily pocketable lightweight point and shoot will never end. For me, it has with the purchase of this camera. It has it all, it allows the full range of control and thus creativity, its produces stunning images with its solid combo of sensor, glass and software. I found it to be lightning fast, easy to use and most of all it doesn&apos;t weigh the 5kgs of my DSLR unit and lenses! I will say though that Canon do need to bolt on a bulb setting to the next edition, though even without it the camera pulls out some great long exposure images. Also, if you decide to invest in a lens converter or filter mount for this camera, be warned, fitting them takes as long as swapping out a ... n SLR lens. For those just starting out in photography or less familiar with cameras don&apos;t let all the knobs and buttons on this camera worry you, this unit is great to learn on as it has a huge section of automatic settings and you can learn to do it all manually and expand your range at the same time. I really love this camera, my best purchase of 2010!

     <Review>The first unit I received had what appeared to be a blotch on the sealed sensor, [...] The replacement works perfectly and I&apos;m enjoying the quality of the images and the depth of the capabilities. The miniature effect is fun and looks like a tilt-shift lens. The HDR effect looks really good, too (the camera takes 3 images at 3 exposures and combines them automatically). Add in the wink self timer, the blink detector, and the smile detection with all the other features and you have a wonderfully small all around camera. It&apos;s too bad that you can&apos;t use the RAW settings for most of the effects. A great advance from my G10. I can use my Canon external flash on this camera (as with most of the G series). I also appreciate the movable LCD screen for macro photography.</Review>

     <Review>I just ordered and received the G12 two weeks ago. I am in the learning phase. I shoot with a Canon DSLR and also have a pocket Canon Point and Shoot--so fortunately the controls and icons are similar. The only complaint I have at this time is the White Balance. I am still experimenting--but the colors are not accurate. I want to do some comparisons with my other cameras. Otherwise I would have given the camera 5 stars. I purchased the G12 to have a smaller camera to use when I do want to take the larger gear. It has been highly recommended by pros as a back up. I have only played with some of the amazing features. I am looking forward to using the built in options (HDR, fisheye, ND filter, etc.)</Review>

     <Review>My Purpose: all around general camera for daily use (also have 5d mll) exploring northern cali Firstly it just feels great in your hand... you can clearly tell this is no typical point &amp; shoot camera. It has a nice weight &amp; build. Upon placing in the card &amp; testing the settings it works beautifully. I was amazed at how beautifully it captures the light. Then the way that you change the f -stop &amp; aperture was just like that on my DSLR. It was a seamless transition! Additional features that made me choose this one are the RAW shooting mode &amp; HD Video. I am very impressed with the quality &amp; ease of use! My roommate after playing with it also decided that she wanted one to use also. This sure beats carrying around my Flip cam + point &amp; shoot!!! I highly reco ... mmend this product

     <Review>Needed a point and shot camera with both a manual mode and RAW. Also wanted to put in a housing to use underwater. This camera serves all those needs. Used for the first time on a trip to Disney---Pictures were of great quality and the video was excellent. I do a lot of photography professionally and own a number of DSLR&apos;s. This camera puts out a very good image quality for its size and easy handling.</Review>

     <Review>Traded in a bunch of lenses and DSLR for the new Canon G12. What a great instrument. I do alot of 4 wheel drive on backroads throughout the West. The G12 is compact and always ready for that scenic shot that requires you to jump out and take the photo without falling behind. The variable screen is extremely handy for down low pictures of flowers, insects and wildlife. Held up high, gives the ability to photgraph scenes over the top of bushes rocks etc.. Great camera for outdoor enthusists. Only slightly larger than a typical point and shoot, it is easily carried in a pocket or belt case.</Review>

     <Review>I am a professional photographer with photography always on my mind. An SLR with a couple of lenses was always the best option, but it was sometimes a uncomfortable to carry that much equipment. I found in this camera a the power and features (manual mode specially) of an SLR in a compact design. Pics quality is superb and carrying it is not a problem. I even started using it for candids in weddings.</Review>

     <Review>This Canon G-12 is a great tool for the person who is more than a weekend or occasional shooter. It is a compact very solidly built digital camera which, in my experience, has very good battery life and a very nice accessory case for easy carrying. One change from previous G models is the swiveling screen which allows for getting good shots at child level or above crowds. That screen is adequate in sharpness but it is not in itself a reason to buy/use the G-12. The only negative that I have experienced is that it is a bit heavy for its size.</Review>

     <Review>First let me state that the 2-star rating is due to the camera&apos;s movie capabilities. For the stills, though havent tried all the settings, I am very satisfied. Also find fault with the viewfinder. Here are my reasons: When shooting a movie and using the zoom feature the camera&apos;s audio picks up whirring and clicking sounds (from the motor). Also the zoom(while in movie mode) is digital zoom not optical and the user has no control over this. When I noticed this I called Canon and was told that this was &apos;not acceptable and the camera I had was faulty. So I exchanged for another one.(Thanks B&amp;H!!). The other camera (still a G12) arrived and I exhibited the same noise problem. Called Canon again and after speaking to several reps finally was reffered to page 30 of the users manual.To quote: ... Pressing the zoom lever will zoom in on the subject. However,operation sounds will be recorded and the movie may appear coarse Translation: You&apos;ll get whirring and clicking sounds in your audio and the camera records at digital zoom. True I could go in and delete the audio portion of the video but if I had recorded other sounds this would be a daunting task. As for the viewfinder: It does not display any settings but they are displayed in the LCD. Thus if one wants to use the viewfinder and adjust or check settings, one has to constantly move the camera from the viewfinder to the LCD,etc. In effect why bother having a viewfinder? Another gripe I have is Canon not including a printed user manual and their lame excuse about &apos;green movement.&apos; I guess all the Canon executives carry around an 8x10 manual at a couple pounds. Or perhaps they have memorized it? Shame on you Canon, if you want to save money cut some of the useless &apos;features.&apos; So, if you can live with the above, I still think it takes great pictures.

     <Review>Pros: The good… The camera produces very nice images that I have no doubt will allow printing up to 12”x18” at near the quality of my D300. The images at ISO 100 and 200 are very clean, and ISO 400 is completely usable. The lens has a little bit of distortion (mainly at the wide end), but it is very sharp. Also, the zoom range is fairly decent. The camera feels nice in-hand, and has all of the controls readily available.

Cons: The bad… My main gripe has to do with the build quality and the price. The build quality is definitely nice, but it doesn’t feel as nice as what a $500 compact should provide. It really should have an all metal body in this price range (only the front plate is metal). Also, some of the dials feel a bit cheap. The other gripe has to do with the contro ... ls. As you adjust aperture/shutter speed/ISO/etc., the camera feels a bit sluggish to respond. It’s not nearly as fast as my 2 year old Panasonic. It’s also not a speed demon when it comes to focusing. It takes about ½ to 1 sec to focus in good light. It’s not bad, but I was hoping for closer to DSLR-speed for a compact camera in the $500 price range. The battery charge indicator isn’t very useful – it goes from 3 bars to dead in about 5 minutes of actual use. However, this syndrome is pretty common with digital compacts. Lastly, the optical finder is almost useless.

Because of the build quality and the sluggish controls, I’m left just a bit disappointed. If I could return it, I probably would. I would probably be satisfied had I only paid $400 for this camera. Despite this, I will still enjoy the nice images that can be produced using this camera.

     <Review>I have a Nikon digital SLR, but the Canon G12 is what I carry in my purse all the time. I had Canon&apos;s Powershot 630A and liked that, too, until it finally gave out. I&apos;d been looking at the G12 and promising myself that if I needed to replace the 630A, I&apos;d buy it, but then I talked myself into buying the more compact s100. After a brief period, I traded it in for the G12. The G12 is one of the larger point-and-shoots but that&apos;s mainly because it has two features I love: an optical viewfinder and an articulated monitor. For me, there&apos;s no contest. It&apos;s well worth the larger size. Furthermore, the controls are beautifully placed and easy to use and the pictures are crisp and clear with beautiful color. The one thing I miss (compared to an SLR) is that in Aperture or Shutter priority modes, y ... ou don&apos;t see the shutter speed (if you&apos;re in Av mode) or the aperture (if you&apos;re in Tv mode) that the camera has chosen. I hope Canon can correct that in the next iteration.

     <Review>Pros: Small / Compact; Fast/accurate auto-focus; Good Image Stabilization; Short Lag Time; Easy To Use; Nice Body Color; Good Image Quality; Large Clear LCD; Good in Low Light

I bought this camera for hiking and backpacking trips, where the weight and bulk of my DSLRs is just a bit too much. My main concern in purchasing a compact camera was image quality, as I&apos;m used to shooting with professional gear. I have not been disappointed!

That&apos;s not to say that this or any compact camera rivals a full-frame Canon DSLR with an L lens attached to it. But I am as pleased with the image quality as I would be using my old XTi with the kit lens. That&apos;s a lot to ask from a camera in this class -- especially considering the XTi&apos;s sensor is 7x larger!

Noise handling at high ISOs ... is great, blows other point and shoots out of the water. The Digic 4 processor does a phenomenal job. The manual controls are intuitive and work well. Even the auto modes are useful, and even fun!

Unless you&apos;re willing to pay much more for the G1X, you simply aren&apos;t going to find better image quality in a compact camera.

     <Review>I was on the fence about what camera I wanted and I tried out the G12. It offers manual control over pretty much everything as advertised and in reviews. It just turned out that I am happier with a simpler PnS with a longer zoom. I think it would be a great camera for someone who really wants to learn the technical aspects of photography. You can use the camera in auto and various scenes if you prefer. If you are familiar with Canons, the operation is familiar. I will say that the viewfinder is pretty useless. I want to say only good things about B&amp;H for their service in shipping the camera and for the return. Everything was timely and I will certainly use them again.</Review>

     <Review>I like the new features (especially the rotating screen and manual setting options) compared to the G7. There is a bit of adjustment to the new settings. I just hope the color selection mechanisms doesn&apos;t die after 5 years like in the previous camera. It is used for photos at workshops, travel and with my family. It definitely meets all our needs.</Review>

     <Review>A digital camera to stay with you at any or all times. Whan your DSLR is too big or not appropriate, and you want high quality images, then the G-12 comes into play. The controls, such as exposure compensation, ISO, program mode, shutter speeds and f/stops, are easy to to find and use. Just a great camera for trips and all around use.</Review>

     <Review>The G12 goes everywhere with me. Fits in my purse. I use Auto the most when I simply want to record an event. I take photos of rooms and like the zoom and wide angle. I belong to a photo group and there is a theme for every meeting...such as Flowers, Night scapes, Animal Portraits, Textures from nature/ Faces,/Bridges etc. and so I use quite a few of the features on the camera. Fundamental, is that it also has a view finder. Whats great is the size and the ease and rapidity in making adjustments . I&apos;m always surprised at how fabulous the photos come out!! Whats bad about it is that it fell in the water and without a warranty I had to buy a new one !!!! But thats OK. My fault, not the g12&apos;s. Thanks for not discontinuing it too soon.

     <Review>I wanted to replace my old Nikon and this product seemed to have the added features that represented an upgrade. I especially like the larger, clearer LCD and the faster cycle time between pictures. The camera is heavier, but contains more power and capability.</Review>

     <Review>The G12 is great for those occasions when my 7D is too heavy or obtrusive. The menus and functions will be familiar to a canon shooter, so it is a quick learning curve. The G12 shoots raw files, will accept canon flashes, has an optical viewer, an articulating display screen. File output in Raw acceptable. Great camera for street photography.</Review>

     <Review>I purchased a Canon PowerShot G12 after using my daughter&apos;s G12 over Christmas. My small digital camera had limited battery left and my daughter&apos;s G12 still had a full charge. The camera was very intuitive. I had never seen nor operated it in the past and found it easy to operate, albeit only on auto. The photos I took with my digital vs. the G12 were incomparable. The G12 took much nicer photos. Additionally, the G12 was very quick. I look forward to learning how to operate the G12 off of its manual setting.</Review>

     <Review>Pros: Build quality extremely solid, picture quality, colors

Cons: Nothing

I purchased this camera before a trip to Lake Tahoe/Heavenly Ski resort as a step up from a cheap Kodak point and shoot. I am extremely impressed with the quality of the pictures. The colors are absolutely brilliant and the focus is quick and spot on. I am a novice with a good eye for a nice picture but this camera makes me look better than I really am. I have played with the various features for low light and different effects, but the &quot;auto&quot; mode is so intuitive it picks the correct setting for any given situation instantly. Even my wife, who sometimes struggled taking a clearly focused shot with the old Kodak, takes beautiful shots now (no offense, dear). The camera was on sale for $379 when I bough ... t it so the value was excellent. As an added note, I do not believe that I need more than 10mp since I am not blowing up wall sized photographs. Highly recommended.

     <Review>I got this camera for Christmas for my wife who complained that point and shoots were too slow to respond. It has lived up to her expectations, and we got some great pictures of our grandkids over Christmas. I like the feel of it, and the many modes that it has to offer, making it a lot of fun to control various aspects of shooting pictures. Fully automatic, set scenes, - experiment! My brother, a professional photographer, was impressed. Sharp pictures, nice depth of field, great color, and maybe I&apos;ll try using RAW. Like having the eye piece to compose some of the shots. We did occasionally miss some shots in fully auto mode, but putting it into the kids/sports mode took care of that.</Review>

     <Review>Great value! Many point and shoot cameras these days offer good picture quality. What I particularly like about the G12 is it&apos;s usability. The menus are not too cumbersome. Locking your exposure and focus is quick and easy making the lagtime relatively short for a point and shoot. That#s where I think most cameras of this type fall down, they&apos;re just too slow! There are faster point and shoot cameras, the Nikon V1, Sony NEX7 for example, but this one has a pricetag less that half that of the Nikon and about a third that of the Sony. For less than $400 I&apos;d call it a good value with not a lot of trade offs for a point and shoot.</Review>

     <Review>I have had a G7 and a G9 and my comments are by way of comparison. The three obvious differences are the flip out back, the construction. and the front wheel. Starting with the front wheel it is a great addition and makes it more like my 5D mark 2. The camera is lighter and doesn&apos;t feel quite as robust as previous models. I&apos;m sure it is strong but the quality of the G7 and G9 made them feel as if they would withstand anything you could throw at them. The flip out, twist about screen worries me a bit but hopefully it will stand the test of time. I went away from the Canon compacts for a while as I wanted a pocket camera but couldn&apos;t stand not having an optical viewfinder in bright sun. I now have the best of both worlds but without any info in the optical view finder I still have to rely o ... n the LCD screen. Overall I am still very happy with my purchase as it offers the point and shoot snap shot usage as well as the almost SLR creative auto over rides.

     <Review>Started with g10 ( 3 ) G 11 (2 ) G12 we will see. Shoot a 5d with no video ability. The 1st g10 took my breath away while doing ice boating assessment for a local tv station. It and I went through the ice, card survived #1. Have lost a few off the motorcycle while shooting &amp; driving action in deals gap Nc. Held up well until bounced off highway at 45mph. The shots have made me great money and the adventures they have been through have been well worth the time. I do recommend this for all the quality ad easy of use. In silent mode great for court room drama! No one has paid me to write this!</Review>

     <Review>I needed a small camera to fit in my purse with more control of the shot than the normal small point and shoot. The G12 is great--I can choose the mode I want to shoot in and it&apos;s much more versatile than my old Canon point and shoot.</Review>

     <Review>Just got the G12 to use for photo and video. Am very pleased with the camera so far. It takes great photos and the video is pretty good. I&apos;ve been especially happy with photos and video in black &amp; white mode. It&apos;s not as speedy (in terms of number of frames you can shoot per second) as would be nice. The camera has a sturdy construction and a good feel. The user interface is intuitive and easy to navigate. I eventually want to upgrade to the 60D, but for now, the G12 will do the job!</Review>

     <Review>As an avid recreational photographer, the G12 is great for is combination of compact size and long feature list. For those of us who can not justify the cost or dont want to be burdened with the weight and size of a DSLR this camera is the best. Having used a G9 for a number of years the G12 was familiar in basic layout, but has many really useful new features. The movable rear display and having common adjustments on the control knobs adds extra versitility over the G9. Multiple zone focus and exposure also adds more control over the G9, and the menu items have brief pop up descriptions, reducing the need to refer to the instruction manual even for lesser used features. Overall a great step forward over the G9, which was no slouch in its time.</Review>

     <Review>The G12 is a very good point and shoot for both video and photos. I purchased it for our student newspaper because I wanted the paper to have a camera that took both high quality photos and was easy enough to use for novices. The G12 fit the bill. It has enough manual controls for photogs, but inexperienced people can still pick it up and go. My only complaint is I wish the spot focus was easier to access and use. All of the other manual controls are very easy to use and feel natural in the hand.</Review>

     <Review>Pros: Everything

Cons: No printed manual (minor)

Had a G11 that I thought was great. So did a friend of mine and out of the blue he offered to buy it for $300.00. Had it for almost three years so I said yes and immediately got the G12. Very happy with it. It goes everywhere I go even when carrying the DSLR. The ;picture quality is still great,, and the new features are fun to play with. I also enjoy the stepped ISO settings and the higher ISO. I shoot RAW 99% of the time so this works well. I only wish it had a printed owners manual. I like to read these in bed and even a notebook computer is awkward. Highly recommend this camera.</Review>

     <Review>I am a frequent traveler who takes lots of photos. I&apos;m getting older and carrying around my digital SLR and its attachments is tiring. I wanted a small camera with wide angle and zoom capability. The Power Shot G 12 is loaded with important extra features and the photos produced are outstanding.</Review>

     <Review>This a a great compliment to my SLR kit. It takes decent shots whilst not weighing the 5 kgs of my EOS 40D and lenses. The camera was obviously designed by people who use cameras as the controls are intuitive. The low light performance is better than expected and the build quality is in keeping with the price.</Review>

     <Review>I am a retired pro and was looking for pocket camera that would give high quality results in a pinch. I would like to have a faster and telephoto lens, but none that I tried were up to the quality I needed. (You need to work in raw format.) I am very pleased with the image quality overall. The close-ups and IS are remarkable. I like the body feel, the controls are positive and the viewer is clear and flexible. The quality won&apos;t let you down.</Review>

     <Review>So far I&apos;ve had this camera about 2 and a half weeks and I really love it. I generally like taking up close shots of things but sometimes those things are hard to get to, or up high, and the SUPER amazing zoom on this camera is wonderful. I love the access to the settings on this camera.(I had a Nikon before and you had to go to menu every time you wanted to change a setting)The hand grip and the shape of the camera are very comfortable to use. And, OH, the flip screen! It&apos;s quite handy for taking pictures at odd angles and getting to see a clear view of the screen. I like the good quality on the videos too, though I don&apos;t use the video very much. There are not many things that i dislike about this camera, but there is a slight lag after taking a picture. But it&apos;s truly a blessing to have ... it.

     <Review>Pros: Fully featured, brilliant night photos, ability to connect a timer remote for time lapse

Cons: Nothing yet!

I&apos;ve had it for about 2 months now and I love it. The picture quality is amazing. I&apos;m still learning how to use it properly but I&apos;m getting the hang of it. Great camera for practice if you want to one day buy a larger DSLR. Its fully featured (to my limited knowledge) and has a dial for aperture as well as a rear dial for shutter speed (or vise versa? still learning). Some cameras in this class have one dial and you would have to go into the menu if you wanted to change the other settings. Not this one though.
I also like the ability to connect an intervalometer since I am learning how to do time lapse photography.
One of the main reasons I got this camera w ... as because I wanted to be able to take nice long exposure night photos. I&apos;m very happy with the results.

     <Review>I have only owned the camera a couple of weeks. I haven&apos;t even had a chance to go over the manual yet. The camera is so user friendly, I haven&apos;t really needed to. It takes beautiful point-and-shoot photos right out of the box. You could probably use it like that forever and it would work great for you but in my explorations so far, I&apos;ve found several useful settings. It has settings for low light, quick shots, portraits, and video, but what I was most intrigued by are the manual capabilities of this camera. Previously, I worked as a photographer&apos;s assistant and owned a Canon 5D digital SLR. I have since chosen a different career path and noticed that the 5D was doing a lot of sitting in it&apos;s case. It was a wonderful camera but was too bulky and expensive to carry around and use dai ... ly. I bought the Powershot G12 because it is a smaller investment, it&apos;s much more compact (especially without all of the flash and lens attachments), and has the ease of use of a point-and-shoot combined with some of the control of a manual SLR. The only thing I don&apos;t love is the close arrangement of the buttons on the back, but I&apos;m sure I&apos;ll get used to it. So far it is taking great pictures and is exactly what I was looking for.

     <Review>The camera is excellent for discreet street shooting. The swing out LCD screen makes it possible to point the camera at a subject and you, looking in another direction. The image quality in good light is excellent for this type if of camera, in poor lighting situation you can still get usable decent images at ISO&apos;s as high as 1600. As a professional photographer having total manual control of all the variables is the only way to go. Although I must say some of the auto modes produce great results. I&apos;m a Canon user and once again they have produced a excellent product that is built well. The only aspect of the camera that is quite useless is the view finder. But with a camera such as this such small view finders seem a waste anyway.</Review>

     <Review>Travel, work sometimes. Compact and powerful camera. Good display, good quality and very good exposure in automatic mode. Good material construction. Looking through the viewfinder is not as good as a pro camera and to many controls on the right side you risk to touch accidentally. I&apos;d have preferred they had left the CF card instead of SD. There is a short delay when you shoot that can gives you some trouble if you shoot sport. Raw files and manual controls make this compact camera a great product.</Review>

     <Review>For a small camera with plenty of features, a cheat sheet is a great idea. This is packed with reference information - more along the lines of reminder hints. You have to know what and why you are looking for something to truly benefit from this cheat sheet. It will take time to memorize the location of the areas of information - like chapters in a book, rather than using an index or table of contents. Nice touch that the area&apos;s are colour coded too - for example: metering, settings, flash etc. And the page is laminated. HOWEVER - would be so much more convenient if it could be folded to the size of the camera for ease of carrying it with you. Let&apos;s face it, small camera - won&apos;t need a big camera bag. This laminated sheet will not fit into my LowePro bag (the Apex 110 AW) without ... ruining it to fold it again. Or perhaps a booklet format would have been easier to use. I&apos;d been willing to pay twice the price for such! So the size for me personally - will be cumbersome to keep with the camera itself.

     <Review>When I wanted to upgrade from my pocket-size Canon Powershot for an upcoming trip to Asia, a friend who is a professional photographer recommended the G12. I was a little concerned I was purchasing more camera than I would know what to do with, but it was just the opposite. The auto setting handles just about everything (even without the flash). Daylight, dusk, caves, partying - it took great pictures and videos in every situation. And, there are lots of manual options that I can grow into.

The best part was when I would ask people to snap a picture of my friends and I they would say &quot;is this the G12?&quot; It was a constant reinforcement that I had made a great purchase.

PROs: Auto can handle just about anything, the special features are fun, the upload speed is really fast (with ... a good memory card), and it&apos;s a really small size for the quality of photos (no bulky lenses).

CONs: the only thing I can really think of is that the zoom isn&apos;t super responsive. When you move the zoom button it takes a moment to start moving.

I wanted the abilty to shoot RAW if desired.</Review>

     <Review>Pros: My mother loves this camera. It is a great step for those that want near-SLR quality without the complication and price of a serious camera. 

Has RAW and some other powerful features that most point-and-shoots don&apos;t.

Cons: A little bit slow between photos, but that doesn&apos;t really bother her.</Review>

     <Review>I was waiting 5 month for this camera. Didn&apos;t want to purchase G11. Superb camera, probably MOST accurate focusing camera out of point n shoot camera&apos;s I ever tried. LOVE how well it focuses in LOW light conditions. After I purchased this camera thru BH photo website, my friend challenged me to see how good this camera will perform vs other consumer cameras. So we took several memory cards and went to local [...] to do some test shoots. We only compared G12 with other $400+ camera&apos;s. Surprisanly G 12 was leading camera when it came to FocusingSkin tonesLow ISO performancePretty amazing. So amoung consumer camera&apos;s it&apos;s SUPERB, but it&apos;s not as good as DSLR for example 5Dii with 35 mm 1.4 lens. (that&apos;s what I use for weddings). So if you want compact camera this ... is it!

     <Review>Pros: HDR mode, High resolution, Image quality, Live view/moveable LCD, Lots of useful options ... Cons: Expensive custom battery Got this for a once in a lifetime trip. I was not disappointed in any way. We have beautiful pictures of landscapes, historical buildings and architecture, insides of castles, nighttime pictures, etc. There was nothing I tried that I couldn&apos;t do. The built-in HDR mode was a big reason I went with the G12. It is everything I hoped for - very cool! It&apos;s not the highest megapixel camera out there, but the image quality is amazing. Canon decided to focus on total camera features and quality rather than cram in the highest Mp. It paid off. The &quot;lowly&quot; 10 Mp images are extremely sharp and crisp and clear. However this is an advanced camera with many features. If you w ... ant the most from this camera, take the time to learn them. When I bought the camera I also bought a digital photography book specific to the G12 and spent a couple of weeks before the trip taking hundreds of pictures as I worked through the book. I think this was key to getting the maximum out of this camera. It is a point &amp; shoot with full auto mode, but I rarely used it. With the practice I had if I needed to change settings, it only took a second or two to select settings that gave me amazing pictures.

     <Review>I use this camera as an alternative to carrying a dslr with all its gear. I am very pleased with the quality of the photos. It is great to have all the option buttons and dials on the surface so one doesn&apos;t have to burrow through menus.</Review>

     <Review>I&apos;ve been a fan of Canon advanced digitals for a while and finally pulled the trigger on the g-series (G12). It was worth the wait!! These cameras can be used for simple point and shoot if you don&apos;t have the time or desire to think much about the mechanics and instead just want to focus on composition. They also have very convenient features for advanced and manual shooting. The focus is very fast and accurate and the menu system is intuitive. The camera is small compared to an SLR but large compared to today&apos;s pocket cams. It is sturdy and has a high build quality... should last under rigorous use (metal body, limited use of plastic). The G-series has been around for some time now for a reason: the cameras are excellent!</Review>
