     <Review>We love: The bristling array of manual controls ....We hate: The time taken to process RAW images....Verdict:An ideal compact substitute for a DSLR The Nikon Coolpix P7000 is being pitched by the imaging giant as the crowning glory of its compact Coolpix range to date, aimed squarely at the dedicated snapper who needs a high spec compact digital camera that still manages to pack many of the settings and options of a full DSLR. Is it a yay or nay from us? Only once you&apos;ve delved into our Nikon Coolpix P7000 review will you know whether to raise a royal cheer or blow a common raspberry. If you&apos;re already a dedicated follower of the Coolpix brand then you&apos;ll remember that the predecessor of the Nikon Coolpix P7000 was released about a year ago, and it only takes seconds to realise how many ch ... anges have been made since the P6000. There&apos;s some heft to the Nikon Coolpix P7000, but it feels very reassuring Even the basic shape of the Nikon Coolpix P7000 has altered dramatically from its forebear – it&apos;s much chunkier and heavier (360g including battery and SD card) and feels reassuringly solid in the hand, despite the front grip having reduced in size. The LCD monitor has noticeably expanded from 2.7″ to 3.00″ and boasts much more detailed images care of the 921,000 dots and a wide viewing angle. The megapixel count on the Nikon Coolpix P7000 has been reduced, however, from 13.5 to a more modest 10.1 but it still makes use of the same large scale 1/1.7-inch image sensor as the P6000. No restraints with the optical zoom, on the other hand, which has increased to a wide-angle 7.1x (the 35mm format equivalent to 28-200mm) and glides smoothly (albeit with a low growl) in operation. Manual settings aplenty on the P7000 The other major transformation in the Nikon Coolpix P7000 is the sheer volume of manual controls which bristle along the top and back like quills on a porcupine. Alongside the usual mode dial (which contains three custom settings and a new Low Noise Night Mode), tiny power button and shutter-with-zoom-ring, the camera now sports an added dedicated manual control dial for fast launching the likes of white balance, ISO and picture quality, plus a large supplementary dial for EV compensation. Somehow Nikon have also managed to squeeze on to the same level a programmable Av/Tv button which perches dangerously close to the edge and is fiddly to locate but is still extremely useful. Check out our Best HD camera Top 5 now One of the new features that can be preset via the Av/Tv button on the Nikon Coolpix P7000 is an electronic Virtual Horizon that&apos;s a Godsend when trying to keep your landscapes in perspective. While the new-improved LCD is an undoubted asset when framing up, the option of using the supplied viewfinder in very bright conditions remains – the down side is that because this is an optical rather than electronic system, only 80% of the frame is viewable – maybe this could be addressed next time. The other raw issue with the Nikon Coolpix P7000 is the, er, RAW issue. The P6000 offered RAW images using Nikon&apos;s own NRW file types which could then be converted only with their own ViewNX software (which wasn&apos;t Mac friendly). The new machine now carries ViewNX 2 which is Mac friendly for the upgraded NRW+ RAW files – three cheers, except each Fine RAW image takes seven seconds to complete so you&apos;re unlikely to do much continuous shooting in this mode. The good news is that the Nikon Coolpix P7000 has dispensed with the lame GPS tagging system of its predecessor, reduced the unnecessarily high ISO 6400 setting to 3200 and installed 720p HD movie-making, complete with an external microphone input for stereo recording. Both still and movie picture quality is exceptionally good, even in the high ISO settings using the in-built noise reduction. The top end PowerShot G shooters now have a serious rival.

     <Review>The revamped Coolpix line of Nikon compact cameras certainly has the look of quality. With the new Nikon P7000&apos;s classic black body and a range of manual dials, it seems on the surface perfect for photographers who know what they&apos;re doing and want a little more control over and quality from their digital compact camera.

But with Nikon P7000 prices around £450, are you better off getting another DSLR to serve as your backup camera?

With Nikon well in the ascendency in the DSLR market, the company is attempting to make hay while the sun shines. The Canon G-series has long been the choice of anyone looking for a (almost) pocketable compact to accompany their DSLR, but with Nikon DSLRs stealing more and more of the limelight, the 10.1MP, all-metal Nikon P7000 could be just the ca ... mera to sway Canon users away. 

With fancy features thin on the ground – 720p video is all you get – and enough manual controls to keep the most experienced photographers happy, the P7000 makes a huge first impression. But how is it in use?

The Nikon P7000 looks the business. Clad in dull, gunmetal black and following the G12&apos;s approach of scattering the toplate with dials and buttons, it is, like its Canon cousin, an intimidating camera at first, particularly if you&apos;re not familiar with terminology such as &quot;BKT&quot;, &quot;QUAL&quot; or &quot;WB&quot; might mean.

But if you are, the Nikon P7000 is a snap to set up. The menu system is excellent, as is the 3-inch, 921,000-pixel monitor, but you won&apos;t have to poke it into action much.

     <Review>Pros: Very good photo quality, with lower-than-average noise levels through ISO 1600; Generally solid body with lots of dials and buttons; 7.1X, 28 - 200 mm zoom lens with image stabilization; Large and very sharp 3-inch LCD display (though it doesn&apos;t rotate); Optical viewfinder (a rarity these days); Tons of manual controls; Auto Scene Selector for the point-and-shoot crowd; Hot shoe for external flash; Customizable buttons, dials, and menus; Built-in neutral density filter and electronic level; Active D-Lighting brightens shadows, restores some highlight detail; Records 720p24 video with stereo sound, use of optical zoom; Redeye not a problem; Stereo microphone input, HDMI output; Optional wide-angle conversion lens, wireless remote

Cons: Very sluggish interface means long waits w ... hen entering/exiting menus or playback mode; Quick Menu dial hardly a time-saver; AF system can be unreliable at times; Exposure can be hit-or-miss -- some highlight clipping -- shadow detail lacking with Active D-Lighting off; Long write times in continuous shooting model; Optical viewfinder is small -- flush design means lots of nose smudges on the LCD; Function (Fn) button not terribly useful; Can&apos;t access memory card when camera is on tripod -- some plasticky parts on top of camera

The Nikon Coolpix P7000 is a feature-packed camera that produces good quality photos and HD videos. The problem is that you spend too much time waiting, and not enough time taking pictures. In photography, timing is everything, and having to wait for menus to appear can cost you a shot. I would be more forgiving if the P7000 was a $199 camera, but it costs 2.5 times more than that. It&apos;s definitely worth looking at, considering all it has to offer, but you should absolutely, positively try one out to see if you can deal with its sluggishness.

     <Review>The Nikon Coolpix P7000 is a camera that combines great image quality, extensive manual controls, and a 7.1X optical zoom lens. 

When you&apos;re behind the lens of the 10-megapixel Nikon Coolpix P7000, you almost feel like you&apos;re at the helm of a jet. The camera is peppered with physical buttons, offering fast access to manual settings via a cockpit-like array of controls. DSLR owners will feel right at home behind the wheel of the Coolpix P7000, which offers great image quality to go along with those extensive imaging controls.

Because the Nikon Coolpix P7000 puts all of its manual controls front and center--more so than any other camera in this roundup--it also has the most challenging learning curve. Novices are bound to be a bit intimidated by its array of buttons and dials, ... but photographers who have used Nikon&apos;s DSLR cameras will welcome the familiar button layout.

It lacks the flip-and-pivot LCD screen of the Canon PowerShot G12, but in other respects the Nikon Coolpix P7000 is the spitting image of the G12. Both offer a flash-supporting hot shoe, a battery-saving optical viewfinder, an electronic level dubbed the &apos;Virtual Horizon&apos;, a lens with 28mm wide-angle coverage and F2.8 maximum aperture; the Nikon&apos;s bulky body is a hair slimmer and lighter than the Canon&apos;s.

The Nikon Coolpix P7000 holds an edge in optical oomph over the Canon PowerShot G12: Its 7.1X optical zoom lens gives it the highest zoom range of any camera in this roundup, stretching from 28mm to 200mm. The Coolpix P7000 also has a superior optical viewfinder; the zoom lens never creeps into your wide-angle view, as happens with the G12&apos;s optical viewfinder.

The 17 buttons on the Nikon Coolpix P7000 provide some amazingly quick shortcuts to the camera&apos;s manual controls. Among them are a one-touch toggle right next to the shutter button for aperture priority and shutter priority, a thumb-operated automatic exposure lock and automatic focus lock button; a custom mode wheel that lets you jump quickly between aperture, shutter, and white-balance bracketing modes, ISO settings, image resolution settings, and on-screen histograms; and a mode dial with three user-defined custom presets. The P7000 takes great photos in Auto mode, but you&apos;ll get a lot more out of this camera by diving into its manual settings.

In our subjective testing of a group of five advanced point-and-shoots for image and video quality, the Nikon Coolpix P7000 finished a close second to the PowerShot G12, with an overall performance mark of superior. The images it snapped were the sharpest ones we saw from any camera in the bunch, and its scores for exposure quality and colour accuracy were only a shade behind those of the G12.

On the other hand, if you plan to shoot a lot of video, you&apos;ll be better off with a different camera: The Nikon Coolpix P7000 finished next-to-last in our subjective tests for video quality, and its 720p footage (at /24 frames per second) outscored only the standard-definition-shooting Samsung TL500 in our tests. The Nikon camera&apos;s battery life is good, with a CIPA rating of 350 shots per charge with the LCD turned on.

Standout features include the unit&apos;s excellent macro mode, which lets you get within an inch of your subject and capture an extremely sharp shot with shallow depth of field. In our tests, the Nikon Coolpix P7000 also did the best job of in-camera editing: After snapping a shot, you can choose to have the camera automatically enhance the image via Nikon&apos;s Active D Lighting correction, Quick Retouch mode, or skin softening; and you can even apply filters such as a Miniature Mode setting.

Unlike competing cameras, the Nikon Coolpix P7000 applies its filters and editing work to a copy of the original image, rather than overwriting the source photo. As is true of the G12, continuous shooting isn&apos;t a strong suit: The P7000 tops out at around 1.3 shots per second at full resolution.

Group test: what&apos;s the best compact camera?

NEXT: our expert verdict &gt;&gt;

     <Review>I bought this little baby as a carry along when I don&apos;t want to drag my D7000 with battery grip and a bag of lenses around. I like the fact that it has lots of control options including custom white balance, bracketing and the ability to shoot RAW! It&apos;s nice to be able to go full manual when you have the time to compose a shot. Picture quality is pretty sweet on this little gem and the macro capability is pretty awesome! The tiny viewfinder is pretty useless, so I always use the screen to compose and shoot. No biggie though, it&apos;s a point and shoot! I also got a generic version of the ML-L3 wireless remote for 2 and a half bucks from another site ;). It&apos;s great when you want to put it on a tabletop tripod or get in a group photo. I don&apos;t shoot much video on this or at all for that mat ... ter, so I can&apos;t comment on video quality. I do have a couple of minor gripes. The light meter is so tiny that when in manual mode you can&apos;t really see whats going on unless you look very closely and the yellow on white indicator marks don&apos;t do well to contrast against each other. Not a deal breaker, but a small annoyance. The aperture range and shutter time are limited. It only stops down to f/8 and the max shutter length is 30 seconds. Again, this is a point and shoot, so these aren&apos;t deal breakers. I guess I was just spoiled by my DSLR! Having said that, I carry this thing EVERYWHERE! Even when I have the D7000 with me, this is in the bag as well. All in all, I think you&apos;d be very happy with this camera. Even though it&apos;s a couple of years old now, it holds up very well. I&apos;ll use this for a long while.

     <Review>I use the P7000 for scenery and macro shots with and without people. I like the picture control customization features, especially the YGRO filtering system when shooting in B&amp;W. These filters work just like the ones I used to use with film cameras. I never seen any other digital camera have this feature. I usually shoot in aperature priority mode and this camera is perfect for that kind of shooting. The controls are there on the camera; not in a menu system when you want to tweak the exposure. I lock the exposure with my thumb on the AE-L button and lock the focus with my index finger on the shutter release button. It couldn&apos;t be easier. Even using the exposure index dial is simple and within easy reach by my thumb. The LCD display is accurate and displays the image large enough for ... you to make decisions about exposure without shooting and enlarging the image first. The popup flash is perfect. You don&apos;t have to remember to turn off the flash because it won&apos;t operate when you leave the flash in the closed position even when you have the camera set for auto flash. The camera is a perfect size and has a good balance to it. I especially like the right hand thumb pad. On other cameras, my thumb keeps changing settings accidently because there is no place for the thumb to rest or grasp the camera without pushing a button. I do wish the flash could work with the wide-angle adapter attached and that it had more power. Sometimes I need a little fill in the foreground, but I have to use an auxillary flash to get the results I want. I wish the LCD flipped up so the low-angle shots could be seen easier. I shoot a lot of landscapes with an object in the foreground that needs to be in a crucial part of the composition. It is hard to do this without taking a photo first then looking at the shot afterwards. This would also come in handy when I am shooting macro shots of plants and insects that are close to the ground. Over all I think this camera delivers and more what Nikon said it would. The Nikon P7000 is easy to operate right out of the box with a lot of features that you can grow into to expand the full features of the camera. Finally, a point and shoot camera with the features of a DSLR but lightweight. 4 1/2 stars.

     <Review>Pros: Ease of use, Great pictures, Great price

Cons: Nothing.

Easy to use. GREAT pictures on program/auto mode. Easy to navigate menu system. Well organized.
Wanted an dSLR for creative reasons but not the size and weight for travel. This offers a great combination of ease of use for those quick shots, or complete creative control for the more complex. GREAT pictures AND video (HD). Many tools to enhance your photographic experience IN the camera.
Just a little slow (compared to regular dSLRs) on first picture and multiple pictures.
LOVE the digital composing.
Compared to the Canon Powershot G12 does very well. With the excellent viewing angle of the screen, do not miss the dislocated screen of the Powershot for off-angle pictures (eg held above head). $100 cheape ... r.

     <Review>I purchased this camera 7 months ago hoping for a mini version of the Nikon D3/D700 in a lightweight, easy to carry body. The camera has got many futures and I use most of them. Menu is very similar to Nikon&apos;s DSLR cameras. I love the manual controls as they make it easier to control the camera. The Nikon SB-400 is a must, to take pictures of people, kids without spending time on red-eyes removal. Many Nikon accessories work very well with the camera such as SC-28 flash cable, hotshoe-PC adapter, old Nikon flashes (manual mode) etc. Overall I&apos;m happy with the product, but there are few things you should keep in mind. It&apos;s not as robust, dust/weather proof as D3 nor D700. Any bit of dust/sand will cause the lens cover to fail and it will not fully open. The part has to be replaced, as ... blowing compressed air doesn&apos;t help. Don&apos;t take it to the beach without the underwater casing or other protective casing. The large crisp LCD screen is not calibrated - colors are not as saturated in reality as shown on the screen. Battery doesn&apos;t last for long as expected, therefore I strongly recommend the second battery when travelling. Still haven&apos;t figured out how to properly set Picture Control settings to my liking and I&apos;m still playing with it. I wished camera had more manual controls. It will never be a Nikon D3/D700 series camera, but for the 1/10th the price you can&apos;t go wrong.

     <Review>Great image quality, with lots of controls. While not as fast or responsive as a DSLR, it performs extremely well for a P&amp;S. Good low light performance, also very quiet operation (no loud click), fun macro capabilities. It has a few peculiarities you need to learn to work with, but well worth the money and time investment. Small size, relatively durable construction. Intuitive design, most-used controls are easily accessible. Shutter lag hasn&apos;t been a problem, but time between shots is a bit slow, even in JPG mode. In low light the autofocus has some challenges, but zoom out a bit and find a high-contrast area on a subject and you&apos;re golden. Huge bright screen is very nice. All in all great camera, very happy with it.</Review>

     <Review>The ease of changing exposure, white balance, ISO, etc. Makes this a quick handling little camera. The control it gives you is quickly done. One of the best features is the 921K dot display, the same quality as on the D7000, and it is gorgeous. It is much easier to grip than small digital cameras and the viewfinder, hotshoe, and RAW capability, are great additions to a small camera! But, of course, it&apos;s really about the images, and the P7000 gives beautiful images, even when enlarged.</Review>

     <Review>After recently purchasing a Lumix DMC-LX5 with the LVF-1, I received the P7000 as a gift from a friend. I had been tempted by the Canon G12 and the Nikon P7000, but settled on the LX5 to get the 24mm wide. Now, with the two cameras to compare, I can safely say I like both of them. The P7000&apos;s 200mm reach is very handy, and, for me, the camera delivers more accurate color. RAW image quality over the iso range is very good - comparable to the LX5 - with fine, well distributed noise that yields a 35mm slide like result. I did notice some significant heating after taking some test video clips and playing back. The camera got hot enough to get very noisy until it cooled down (about 5 minutes). Operation is still sluggish with the latest firmware. The lens cover hung a bit after I used it in a d ... usty environment, but it recovered itself. Since the latest ACR plugin has lens correction for the P7000, there is essentially no distortion, CA or vignetting post processing. Lens is excellent up to 135 equivalent, very good centrally at 200mm equivalent. The three User modes are a great addition, especially considering how cumbersome it is to make setting changes. For me, U1 is for landscape, U2 is for landscape with autobracketing, U3 is for grabshots. I&apos;m now carrying both compacts in a small case for trail and travel use.

     <Review>As a professional photographer I own some great DLSR and lenses, but at times I don&apos;t want carry all that with me. After researching, I decided the P7000 was going to be exactly what I wanted. Turned out it is exactly what I wanted! Note: I only researched Nikon, but the Cannon G11 is a similar camera that is supposed to be great also. This camera is great for shooting photos around my home, of my pets, family functions and trips. The flexibility of shooting in automatic, a priority mode or all manual is great. Manual mode is really easy to use, two dials control the aperture and shutter speed, the exposure indicator is helpful along with the histogram. Both are small on the display, but still easy enough to view. ISO, WB and quality are all easily accessible on a dial. The camer ... a handles high ISO and ow light situations very well, much like my DLSRs. The auto white balance does well on indoor lighting. There is no shutter lag, but there is a delay after the photo is taken and the information is being written on the card before you can take another image. I have not used the camera in a situation where this would be an inconvenience, but it may be when shooting a sporting event or such. the focus is very sharp. Macro setting is great. The camera is definitely not small and will fit in your pocket only if you have a large pocket. I love the retro look, multiple dials on the top of the camera to access functions, it is not slim and sleek. The shape doesn&apos;t fit the best in my hand, but it may be because I am used to a much larger DLSR. It is an amazing point and shoot. I would definitely recommend it to any one who wants the control of manual exposure and the flexibility of a point and shoot. I have been using it constantly since I received it in the mail. It is just so much fun to have a little camera that functions like my DSLRs!

     <Review>Nikon finally fixed those things people did not like about the P90, P100 and L110. Lens protecting mechanism is a plus. Quality photos with good sharpness and color. Intuitive controls. Separate battery charger allows you to shoot with a backup battery while recharging the original battery. Have not used movie function yet. It is a bit pricey, but I believe it is the best quality point and shoot camera available now.</Review>

     <Review>This was not a gift. I have been a nikon shooter for many years and wanted to stay with Nikon technology for my point and shoot camera. As it turned out, it is a little more than I expected in a point and shoot camera. I was able to program and use this camera without opening the manual. The menus are very easy to move around in and understand. In fact, the ability to load 3 different mini shooting banks, U1,U2 and U3,into one of the top camera dials is really a nice feature. Having the majority of the controls on the top of the camera like my SLR&apos;s makes me feel right at home. I was a little disappointed in the speed it takes to write a raw file to the card, 4 to 5 seconds, but I do not intend to shoot sports with this camera. The color is as good as my expensive SLR&apos;s and the stabilizer ... does a great job on hand held subjects. The view finder is a little small but can be used if necessary. The focusing light indicator is also right next to the view finder and can be distracting. The built in Scene Programs all seem to be excellent which is great for my personal use. I will use this as my backup camera when I travel to lighten my load without any hesitation. I did detect motor noise on the audio when shooting video however an external mike took care of the problem. I advise buying a spare battery or two if you are going to do some serious shooting and editing.

     <Review>I have had this camera for about 2 weeks now. So far it seems well built and has been pretty user friendly. The battery life isn&apos;t that great (good for about 3-4 hours of shooting). I don&apos;t like the fact that I am forced to use Nikon software to transfer the pictures onto my computer (or an SD card reader). Also, the top menu dial is great for quick adjustments, but i wish they would also let you select some of those options in the main menu. The HDMI port is not a standard size so an adapter is needed. The video quality is not that great. All and all it takes great pictures and I am very happy with the camera.</Review>

     <Review>Having for a long time looked for an alternative to my heavy D700 for day to day photography, I&apos;ve found with the P7000 the ideal companion. It allows a huge bunch on settings, to work in expert modes (as on a reflex), and the most important, it fires nearly instantaneously. The image quality at 800 iso is awesome. Even at 1600, it is still possible to make some nice prints. Using the raw files allows to treat the image with a dedicated software for even better results. 3200 iso still gives details, but they are quite unsharp. I particularly appreciate the dedicated ring to set the exposure compensation, with a LED indicating you&apos;re not at zero. Very clever from Nikon&apos;s engineers. On wide angle position, the lens shows a visible distortion, but the built-in compensation of the camera brins ... it back to zero: impressive. The wide angle position could have been wider (28mm is not enough in some conditions), but the zoom amplitude is comfortable (max. 200mm). Don&apos;t expect miracles at this position, but nevertheless, the internal treatment delivers images always sharp, even in bad light conditions. Bad lights is the reason that led me to buy this camera. Taking picture during concerts, even far from the stage is not a problem anymore (if you allow the autofocus to take its time at 200mm, seen the aperture of only 1:5,6). In sunny conditions, however, hight light are easily burnt. Its better to check the histogram and to under-expose. The built-in D lighting will compensate the darkness of dark zones. In these conditions, the optical viewfinder is good to have, despite the fact that it doesn&apos;t cover the entire image that will be taken. As said earlier, this expert compact camera is fully configurable to suit the most expert photographer preferences. On the other hand, should you give it to someone who is not familiar with complicated cameras, you may set it on green or even easier, on automatic scene recognition mode and let the Nikon work for you. Start-up time is a little big too long for me, as well as the time it needs between two shots. Nevertheless, this is compensated by the nearly immediate firing (provided that you&apos;ve focused previously). Video mode allows to zoom when filming, and gives HD movies with a reasonable sound quality. Slightly too big to be kept in your pocket, it is supplied with a shoulder strap. As a conclusion to this review, I could only recommend expert photographers wanting to have a compact camera always with them to buy a P7000, it will always be capable to bring good quality pictures in most of the conditions a photographer could meet.

     <Review>I travel a lot and after 20 years of lugging an SLR and DSLR camera,lenses,filters, etc., I wanted to carry a small but quality camera. This camera produces excellent pictures for such a small camera. There are many features and this is not a camera for a beginner. To get the most out of the P7000, you need to learn all the controls and read the manual. The pictures come out well exposed, to the point that post production adjustments are minor to nil. You have almost complete control over the shot or you could set it to complete automatic. The LCD display is extraordinary. The controls are nicely placed. The build of the camera reflects high quality. What things aren&apos;t so great would be the autofocus system can be tempermental. You really have to be in a certain range (it is in the manual) ... to get the green light to take the shot. Sometimes the lens can be slow to go to telephoto legnth, and it can be jerky. The learning curve can be steep unless you are familiar with the Nikon menu system. All in all though it is well worth the price and produces some really great pictures all the way down to macro. Highly recommended!

     <Review>P7000 Review First off let me say this, this camera is NOT a replacement for an SLR. For low light situations, or tacking pictures quickly of fast moving subjects there is no substitute for an SLR. That said, this is still am impressive little camera. Pros:??? EV Dial. Having a dedicated dial to adjust the EV settings is very convenient. I have found that the camera tends to make shots alittle to dark for my tastes, so I often shoot at it +.3 to overcome this??? Picture controls. I own a D700 and love how I can fine tune the saturation and hue to make colors pop. This camera will also allow you to do this, and it makes a noticeable improvement.??? The 3 User settings on the main command dial. You can program some very unique settings into the camera and quickly recall them for m ... any situations. ??? The hot shoe is great for mounting on a real flash. This built in flash works well on anything that is close to the camera, but it is very weak in even slightly demanding situations. ??? White Balance. You can program three preset custom white balance cards. I use an Expodisc for my D700, you can use it for this little camera too! (Do not press the disk too hard over the lens or you could damage it) Also you can adjust the white balance manually by degrees Kelvin, just as with a pro SLR.Cons:??? ISO performance. I have to disagree strongly with the cameras proclaimed ability to do very well in low light. Pictures are noticeably noisy starting at ISO 400, so I try to limit it to only 200 or so. ??? Autofocus. In optimum situations it works fine, but when zoomed out it can really start hunting for a lock on. After three or four failed attempts the camera actually will display a reinitializing the lens message, and will retract and redeploy the lens.. You can focus manually, and it displays a magnified image of what you&apos;re focusing on in the center to assist you. But it&apos;s a cumbersome system.??? Battery Indicator. The camera only tells you the battery power remaining when it&apos;s about to die!?! ??? Menu settings. There are certain functions in the camera that are locked out depending on which shooting mode you have the camera set. For example Interval Timer is locked out of the main P,S,A,M priority settings???...why???? WB Balance. Yes I listed the WB as a Pro above, but it also has a negative. Under normal in the house lighting everything is yellow, and I mean VERY yellow. This is easily overcome by fine tuning the white balance, but it&apos;s still an extra step that might cause you to miss a good shot. ??? View Finder. The viewfinder is useful for bright sunny days, but it only covers 80% of the frame. What it covers is perfectly centered, but you have to bear that in mind when composing images. ??? Low light function. Turn this on and see for yourself. Very noisy right from the screen! It&apos;s a very nice camera if you understand its limitations, anyone who loves fine tuning with settings on their SLR&apos;s will love this as a causal take everywhere camera.

     <Review>I eagerly awaited this camera as a replacement for my Canon G10. I&apos;m a Nikon fan-boy and was glad to see Nikon in this market segment. Alas, there are several deal breakers that put this camera behind it&apos;s chief rival. I bought the camera yesterday from the 9th Ave store and I&apos;m returning it today. There was no floor sample for me to try.I saw a review and forum postings on [@] and didn&apos;t believe them. Image quality seems near- or equal-DSLR. I didn&apos;t bother with reviewing the images after I realized I don&apos;t want a camera with this kind of performance. Here&apos;s my experience with the camera, as limited as it is.1) No RAW buffer. The camera locks after a RAW image is captured and does not release until the file is written. Most enthusiasts and pros shoot RAW. Hello, Nikon, I thought you were ... listening to your customers. This is so eight years ago.2) Slow refresh after menu settings. The G10 returns to the image preview instantly after a setting has been changed. The Nikon hesitates before refreshing the screen. Especially annoying after changing ISO or White Balance. The Canon has a ISO dial. At least the Nikon has a dial for exposure compensation.3) Itsy-bitsy dials and buttons. I don&apos;t have large hands, but the controls seemed tiny to me, especially compared to the G10. The control wheel on the back of the camera, near the top of the body is too small to move easily, as are the other controls on the top of the body. Nikon is known for it&apos;s ergonomics, but who tested this camera?4) The camera got warm. The right thumb rest on the back of the body got warm after only a few minutes of use. Wasting energy here; Nikon claims 350 exposures per charge. I wonder if that&apos;s optimistic. And, no replacement battery is available as of this writing.5) Where&apos;s the articulated LCD? Canon G11 has one, other Nikon models have them. If you have to use the screen to aim the camera, why not have the convenience one that swings and rotates? 6) Why not a 24mm equivalent? OK, maybe it would have to be only 135mm or 180mm at the long end. I could live with that for a ultra wide. The screw on 20 or 21mm accessory lens is a colossal inconvenience; I had one on a Konica Minolta A2. What are the engineers thinking?7) Still no 100% optical view finder. I HATE holding the camera at arms length to aim it: think camera shake and discrete image-making. Perhaps I speak for my colleagues when I contend we would prefer a true, 100% optical view finder. The ancient Nikon SP range finder film camera had one, the Leica has one. To fix these objections, the camera might have to be larger, but it would be a real photography tool.

     <Review>I was at first confounded by the menus but I&apos;m growing acustom to them and I am getting to like them. They are no intuitive to me. The camera does lag a bit when switching from preview to shooting mode. I was quite impressed with the flash, small size but lots of power. Battery consumption is very favorable and the picture quality under a variety of conditions I do like. If you are a Nikon shooter like me this camera will take some of your existing flash accessories including the SU800. I&apos;m so pleased I purchased another with the intent to convert to IR.</Review>

     <Review>I love this little camera! My day job as a commercial pilot takes me all over and having an almost SLR-like camera in a small package is huge to me. Packing this along instead of my SLRs is cake. The image quality, build, and abilities of the camera are wonderful. From full manual control to a worthy zoom it is basically everything I wanted in a compact. My previous &apos;travel&apos; camera was the Sigma DP1 (phenomenal sensor/image quality), which is great in its own right but the P7000 goes a step further in overall usefulness. I wanted something with a faster start up time, good zoom and better auto-focusing for playing outside. The P7000 has all this and then some. In fact, my last trip to the Philippines I brought this along instead of one my SLRs. I wasn&apos;t disappointed! Only compl ... aint I can muster is the viewfinder, but the LCD does a good job so it was a matter of adjustment really. While definitely not a replacement for my SLRs, it is a great little camera to have along at all times. Highly recommended!

     <Review>-I bought the camera having experience with Canon&apos;s PowerShot G3. I wanted to have a smaller point-and-shoot camera, but one that had additional functions that I could use with ease. -The use of several knobs rather than one or two menus makes this camera, in my opinion, very easy to use. The most commonly used functions are within one or two button or knob manipulations. -The size of the LCD screen is great, but I&apos;m also used to the PowerShot&apos;s smaller screen. Screen resolution is good too. It would be nice to turn off display of certain functions that mean little to me, but I&apos;m not aware of any camera that is able to do that. -On a trip to the mountains, the large screen and lens capability allowed me to quickly take large area shots that appeal to me. It also did great on a few clo ... se-ups, although I haven&apos;t fully explored its capabilities at close range.

     <Review>I wanted a camera easier to carry than a DSLR without giving up the ability to shoot RAW or getting the reduced features of most point &amp; shoots. The P7000 came with a solid set of controls and makes a nice companion to my DSLR. Some of the most useful settings are accessed or set with buttons and wheels on the camera body making them easier to set without having to burrow into multi layered menus. The body size is easy to hold but not hard to carry. I would not call it a pocket camera and I carry mine in a small case on my belt. Image quality is good. Images at ISO800 are very nice. With the VR on and slow sync flash I shot a number of hand held street scenes at night that came out very well. I&apos;ve shot up 3200 and noise picks up quite a bit depending on the lighting. Focus ... is good though on occasion it doesn&apos;t lock onto something I think it ought to. Moving the frame slightly takes care of it. JPEGs are good. In less than ideal light, colors come out a bit better shooting RAW. I also wanted a view finder for the times when the sun is bright enough to make the LCD hard to see. The LCD turned out to be better than I was used to from point and shoots and in a week at Disney I used the view finder once or twice. It&apos;s just a basic view finder without focus or shot information displayed. I updated the firmware to version 1.1 which made a noticeable improvement in RAW write time and the lag in the LCD updating as the Quick Menu dial is rotated. With the firmware updated the RAW write time was a fraction of a second behind my D7000. The RAW files are an NRW format not NEF. If you&apos;re a CaptureNX 2 or ViewNX 2 user it&apos;s not a problem. ViewNX 2 comes free and will convert to a TIFF or JPEG if your using something else. For me the P7000 is easy to carry when I don&apos;t want the bulk of a DSLR and with enough controls and features I can still do something creative along the way.

     <Review>I&apos;m using this to teach my grandson photography. It can operate in point-and-shoot mode for now. As his experience grows, he will be able to control aperture, shutter speed and focus. I&apos;m pleased with the control over ISO, white balance and exposure compensation not found on other cameras. I really appreciate the optical finder. I find it frustrating when you can&apos;t see the typical camera&apos;s LCD in bright light.</Review>

     <Review>I chose the Nikon P7000 to supplement my DSLR. I&apos;ve been using it for about a week. I wanted a camera that was less conspicuous, more portable, had a long zoom, good macro capabilities, allowed easy manual, and produced quality images control. So far it meets all my expectations. The Lowepro case recommended by B&amp;H for this model is a bit small to include anything in addition to the camera (like a spare battery).</Review>

     <Review>The learning curve is a bit steep and only similar to my Nikon professional products. This is a great camera for the pro to carry for none professional use, (vacations and such) where lugging the gear is not practical or necessary. Results are good when shooting in the automatic mode, but somewhat cumbersome when controlling shutter speed and F stops. The camera is slow to react between viewing a photo and shooting again. Start-up from off is faster. There is a shooting lag time that I cannot get used to after spending so much time with my D2-H and D-300s. The camera needs the wide angle attachment to satisfy even moderate wide shots. But, that&apos;s another expense and it takes time to mount the extra lens. The Macro feature works very well. The HD video is a plus and the microphone input wor ... ks with my professional mics. The Auto focus in video mode does not work well when zooming. It&apos;s better to setup the shot, focus and then shoot. All in all the P7000 is a giant step up from most point and shoots, but too much of a compromise for those who are use to Pro gear.

     <Review>Small, excellent photo quality, good lens, and more features than most similar cameras. Battery life is very good. One battery supports a day of fairly intense shooting. I bought a second battery as a backup, but never needed it. Charged the used battery overnight and was ready for another day of shooting. Also purchased the 32Gb memory card, which will record at store 1600 RAW with JPEG images. In camera JPEG processing is good, and allows photos to be emailed to friends and family during trip. You will need a large hard drive for your PC when you return home for image storage and archiving.</Review>

     <Review>A fine camera to take when you don&apos;t have the time or hands to carry anything more. I use it for kids parties and places where a full-sized SLR would just look out of place. Snapshot territory. Lots of customizable features like a SLR, but only wish it was a little quicker. Need to get camera set up before you shoot. Making on the fly adjustments take some time since many tunings are menu driven. But it has all the basics on handy dials, so changing the exposure, shooting settings and even the major camera functions such as WB can be done quickly. Also, has an amazing view screen. Eyepiece a little on the useless side. Even though it&apos;s only (a relative term) 10MP, it has a better quality sensor, so your photos will look excellent with great contrast and color definition. I had a P90 an ... d I must admit the images and color definition were garbage compared to the P7000. On the negative, it&apos;s just a little slow, which should be expected. Get a fast SD card and that should help a little bit. Definitely a fun solid-feeling point and shoot camera for when you want to take good quality photos without all the bulk. It&apos;s like a P&amp;S for the pro.

     <Review>The Nikon P7000 is a sophisticated camera capable of many functions that the average point and shoot person will never use. At the same time, it functions well as the point and shoot that it is advertised to be. Overall, one of the best features of this camera is that it follows closely the controls and functions of Nikon&apos;s better DSLR&apos;s. To illustrate, I bought the P7000 to supplement my D300 (w/ Nikkor 18-200mm VR lens) on an international study tour I am leading this summer. I wanted a point and shoot to carry on occasions when lugging the D300 around would be overkill -- e.g., informal pictures in cafes, restaurants, on the tour bus etc. At the same time, I didn&apos;t want a cheapie pocket camera. The P7000 is perfect. It functions in ways reminiscent of my D300 (and before that my D50). T ... his makes it easier to use -- I don&apos;t have to learn different routines. Another reason I chose the P7000 is because it has a rangefinder. Some may say it is pointless (pun intended) in a day with bright, high definition LCD screens. A fixed rangefinder takes us back to Kodak Brownie camera days, doesn&apos;t it? (Oops... I just dated myself! :) Anyway, I like the rangefinder because it provides a practical way of framing shots in low light or in settings where the the subject is rapidly moving. Use the rangefinder to point, then shoot. Result?... a high quality digital image. Imagine that! One thing the P7000 is not is a pocket camera. So, give up the idea of a thin profile, carry-it-around-in-your-shirt-pocket type of camera. If that is what you want, consider one of Nikon&apos;s S series cameras. Even though I recognized this, I still hoped to carry it easily without using the supplied neck strap emblazoned with Coolpix in yellow letters. So, I ordered the fitted P7000 Horizontal Leather Case (Mfr. # 9817). You won&apos;t find a lot of information about this case ??? what it does and does not do. Let me recommend you consider it anyway. It does not have a separate strap, but makes use of the neck strap supplied with the camera. When used like this, it becomes a kind of eveready case, except it is not attached to the camera. What I like about this case (and would have had one sewn on if it had not had it) is the belt loop. The camera is light enough to carry on a man&apos;s belt without causing problems -- i.e., weighing down your trousers. (For those of you with shrinking or non-existent glutes, this is an important consideration! :)) The only thing that should have be included, but isn&apos;t, is a wrist strap for the P7000. So, I will be getting one, for sure. Imagine pulling the camera out of the case and forgetting it is not attached to anything. You could find yourself waving goodbye to your P7000 camera as it sails over the edge of a cliff or drops into the water from the deck of a ferry. This camera needs a wrist strap. Nikon missed an opportunity to do something creative as well as practical here. I have no hesitation recommending the Nikon P7000, especially to those DSLR users who would like a quality backup or supplemental camera for special trips, family gatherings when the SLR would be overkill, and other such occasions as may arise when you don&apos;t want to lug around the heavy duty equipment. I give it 5 stars because it does what it is supposed to do well. Just make sure that this is the kind of point and shoot you want. If you really want a pocket camera, then don&apos;t set yourself up for frustration; look at the Nikon S models. But if you want an easy to use versatile camera that you can use to adjust as well as make images, then the P7000 is the top of the P series line in Nikon. You can&apos;t go wrong.

     <Review>Been shooting Nikon DSLR&apos;s for years. I know how to process Raw images and the value of using RAW. This is the only compact camera I&apos;ve found that produces a good RAW file. If you are a DSLR shooter and you need a compact pocket camera, this is your camera. You&apos;ll see some discussion as to whether or not it is a pocket camera, but as a photographer you should have bigger pockets than the normal person. For a photographer, this is a pocket camera. What it isn&apos;t is fast. With firmware 1.1 your processing times on RAW are about 3-4 seconds. A huge improvement over 1.0, but still a bit slow for any action shooting. AF is slow relative to a DSLR, but again you have to look at it&apos;s price point and what you are comparing it to. It does have tons of features and all adjustments are easy to ... get to and make if you are used to DSLR menus. The built in flash is usefull for close shots, but the SB-400 is probably a useful accessory. White balance is good and you have the ability to use custom white balance just like the big boys and in my opinion it is an under utilized feature among shooter. It&apos;s an easy camera to handhold and get the shot at low shutter speeds. Lots of choices for metering, not so many for Auto Focus, but again.... Although NX2 is an additional cost, if you don&apos;t have it, it is worth buying. If you learn to use it, you will be rewarded in the quality of images you can produce. It is a slow program and benefits from being loaded to a RAMDISK or SSD even on a machine that handles Photoshop easily. VIEWNX 2.2 is a huge improvement over the previous versions of View and is FREE. Download it and you won&apos;t be sorry. Actually, lots of adjustments even to RAW files can be done in View and done well. You may wish to try View first and then decide if you need the plethera of adjustments NX2 affords over View. Shutter delay is not great, but not bad in manual settings. Of course it isn&apos;t bad relative to the price point. Zoom could be longer, but it would cause a trade off in image quality. In reality for my purposes I wish it would go wider and not longer. I find myself backing up in to walls a lot. I used this as a replacement for a LUMIX GF-1 with 4 lenses and EVF and have been thrilled.

     <Review>A versatile carry-around camera for the person who wants the option of automatic photography AND the option of complete picture control. With terms and functions familiar to Nikon DSLR users, this camera is for the user desiring high image quality in RAW and/or JPEG format. Dials and buttons allow most setting changes without accessing menus. An extensive Set Up menu allows functional customization and video access is quick and fool proof. The opportunity to download and study the camera manual from the Nikon Website allows a potential purchaser to become aware of the extensive features of this unit. The size and weight of the camera limits pocketability to larger pockets! I would recommend this to a friend who is interested in producing excellent pictures and is willing to spend ... some time learning the many features of the camera.

     <Review>I reach for this camera to take photos in challenging lighting situations like school basements, snow sports and church events. The photos are tack sharp and do not require computer processing. The choice of control over the camera settings will please any DSLR photographer. The camera size is larger than expected but still fits in my jacket pocket.</Review>

Good small camera to carry. Great optics and photo results. Auto focus is a challenge in Macro mode. The lens cover began only partially opening, as has been the case for others.</Review>

     <Review>The P7000 is a great, great camera. Small and easy to use, it still packs in all the features you&apos;d want in a DSLR without the weight and hassle of carrying around a big system. I often use it in tandem with my DSLR while climbing, as it fits in a pocket and has a huge range with the 28-300mm lens. And, it shoots pretty nice video, too. My only complaints are fairly minor ones: 1. the menus and options seem to run a bit slow, especially the delete image option. 2. Would be nice to have the option to add an external mic for better audio on videos.</Review>

     <Review>Pros: Large Clear LCD; Great Zoom; Easy To Use; Good Image Quality; Fast/accurate auto-focus; Good Image Stabilization

Cons: LCD does not articulate

Bought to replace my P5100 which was underwhelming to say the least. I looked at the G series Canons, but this Nikon is much more capable. The LCD does not articulate like the G-12, but it is a full 3 inches and has better resolution. Video is not something I am vitally interested in, but when I tried it, I was floored by its quality. Remember, this is not a DSLR (nor is it a camcorder), so don&apos;t expect it to produce what a full-frame DSLR will. It has full manual controls and is now my backup to my D3&apos;s and D700 at photoshoots. I normally keep it in my glove box of my car as I scan about, looking for that fabled female model str ... eaker. I recommend getting a small, light tripod, or even a monopod if you get more serious about shooting.

     <Review>I ordered this camera to take as a casual alternate to my d300s. It&apos;s lightweight, works incredibly smoothly and takes minimal use to work out any bells and whistles that come with this kind of Point and shoot. Video also looks great. Having a viewfinder is also very nice since I don&apos;t typically enjoy using the screen to frame my shots with. Using at parties and walking around make for an enjoyable experience. Due to the size it&apos;s clearly meant to be carried around on a shoulder strap, but in a pinch, you can cram it into a back pocket on a pair of jeans as well.</Review>

     <Review>It is a sturdily built little camera and has a view finder! Yay! You can actually photograph in the bright sun and see what you are doing. The photos are sharp, there is no appreciable shutter lag, the zoom works well and the controls are located in convenient spots for easy access. Many of the most used functions are available via the buttons and dials so you don&apos;t have to go into the menus all that often. I must say that with all of the features and video capability it is a complex piece of equipment but if you don&apos;t want the complexity you can just set the dial to program mode and shoot away. The camera has a hot shoe and is capable of using an external flash rather than the built in pop up flash. I have not as yet used the video capability so I can&apos;t comment on that. I bought the cam ... era as a backup to my DSLR and to use when I didn&apos;t have the DSLR handy or didn&apos;t want to lug it with me.

     <Review>This camera is very nicely designed, with all of the controls of a DSLR readily available on knobs or buttons instead of buried in menus. Anyone familiar with the layout of a Nikon DSLR will find themselves very much at home. Picture quality is excellent for a small format camera and it has decent low-light performance. However, the autofocus is slow and not very accurate compared to a DSLR. I typically use the mode where I can set the focus point manually. Compared to the DSLRs I&apos;ve used (D90, D200, D7000) the P7000 autofocus is very frustrating. The pipper will turn green (indicating that what&apos;s under it is in focus), only to have it turn out on closer inspection that this is not the case. It is a great pleasure to go back to the D7000 and have the autofocus lock quickly and accur ... ately every time.

     <Review>I wanted something that was smaller and lighter than my Nikon DSLR but still took great photos. I bought a Canon S90, but it never felt right. The buttons were in the wrong place, my fingers couldn&apos;t find a natural handhold, and I missed having a viewfinder. The P7000 felt right from the minute I picked it up. It does well in auto and also gives me all the flexibility to shoot manually. The controls make intuitive sense. Plus I love the longer zoom. The colors also need less adjusting in post processing. I&apos;m very pleased with my purchase.</Review>

     <Review>I have only owned a Nikon CoolPix P7000 for about a month. But I am very content so far with its performance. I wanted a camera that I could always bring with me where ever I go. Small enough to fit into a pocket, but with high enough quality of lens and image recording to be able to work with the results. The P7000 has not disappointed me yet. I find the buttons and dials very functional. I particularly like the separate &apos;wheel&apos; which one can change either the shutter speed or aperture setting, depending on the choice one makes. My only critisism is that it seems a little slow in recovery, between shots when set to the Raw image recording. But it may be that I&apos;m too impatient to wait even a short time!</Review>

     <Review>My wife and I were looking for a digital rangefinder to augment our Nikon DSLR, primarily for travel. Liking Nikons we were glad to finally find the P7000. We are still getting used to it and it seems to have the full complement of features and in some way the settings are more accessible than the DSLR. The 10 megs give good resolution. I like having the one click access to ISO and white balance settings. The one thing I don&apos;t like is not being about to see my f-stop, metering or shutter speed settings through the rangefinder. Having to move in and out to see the screen is cumbersome. The shutter seems to have a little lag to it. But overall, we like the heft and operation</Review>

     <Review>I got the P7000 as a carry everywhere when I could carry my DSLR. It has all the features and controls of a pro DSLR in a compact size. Image quality is excellent.</Review>

     <Review>I am very happy with the P7000. It is a solid performer. It has excellent auto white balance and takes great photos and video. It is also well built. The Canon G12 may have it beat in a couple of areas (performance of writing RAW and general speed of of using the menu system) but the P7000 is close behind. The P7000 has a larger zoom range and it shoots Nikon RAW so I can use Nikon tools (for me, that was important, may not matter for others). I think Nikon got this one right and got it on par (but not surpassing) with competitors.</Review>

     <Review>I have a Nikon D80 from before and was looking for a camera who was smaler and easy to use in the city and when I travel. This camera satisfying me almost complete. I miss a better protection for the lens. But else this is a perfect camera, takes great pictures with good colors and they are really sharp. I like the HD filming function where you can zoom and also record sound. It has a lot of control-weels so it is easy to use. So it has Only one problem: no good protection for the lens. But that is the same for all these cameras.</Review>

     <Review>I am a Nikon D300 user and bought this camera to carry around in my pocket. I have taken 250 pictures, from handheld Chicago skyline at night to indoor hockey games of my grandson and am very pleased with the picture quality. It is very compact and user friendly with a lot of flexibility. Dials make settings easy and the menus are self explanatory. The zoom works smoothly and takes clear shots even in digital mode. The viewfinder does take some time to adjust to ambient light setting and it is nice to have the optical viewfinder. It&apos;s no DSLR for action photos but isn&apos;t meant to be and the action scene mode provides reasonable results. Highly recommend.</Review>

     <Review>This is to replace a Lumix point and shoot because it does not have a viewfinder. Although the Lumix is still functional bright sunlight prevents seeing what you are focusing on. I have a D80 and the similarity of the P7000 and the D80 functions make this a great addition. The viewfinder allows composition when the sun is too bright and the screen on the back comfortably large for easy viewing. It is, of course, bulkier than the Lumix but not so that it won&apos;t fit in a jacket pocket.</Review>

     <Review>There are several things about this camera, that if I&apos;d know about before I purchased it, I would not have bought it. 1. The buttons and dials on the back of the camera are very touchy. One light brush with your finger and you are off to the races going places you did not intend to. 2. The auto focus does not always work, forcing manual focus use. 3. There is no way to review a shot without pressing a button to bring the shot on to the LCD screen. On most cameras you get to review the shot automatically without having to press an additional button. If you take 100s of photos in a day this process gets old fast. 4. This camera has a very wide angle lens. Beware the wide angle when taking portraits or other photos that suffer from the distortion of the wide angle. The camera take high ... quality images and it feels great in your hand, but the issues I mentioned above are beginning to make me sorry I bought this camera.

     <Review>I bought the P7000 to carry on business/pleasure trips when it would be inconvenient to lug my full DSLR camera bag. The features are extensive and the User-defined modes allow me to preset things like bracketing for HDR shots in advance. The LCD is very bright and clear and the controls are well-placed and reasonably intuitive. I do recommend spending a few hours with the manual. Oh, and don&apos;t forget to upgrade the firmware when you first get one.</Review>

     <Review>Lots of buttons and lots of menus but not intuitive. Quirky: I&apos;d raise the flash in A or program mode but it would not fire regardless of the flash mode selected. I thought it was defective. Checked the manual. Turns out that the continuous setting has to be set to single for the flash to work. Studying the manual is required regardless of how many digital Nikons you have. The 3 HD LCD is great - the same as on my D90. Good battery life, but do get a spare. I like the best shot feature, but it takes some menu surfing to find it. You can take up to 10 continuous photos and the camera will select the sharpest. Perfect for dim museums and cathedrals. The camera also has considerable non-destructive editing capabilities and an HDR feature. You will spend an unusual amunt of time in ... the menus (it does have a green setting).

     <Review>Currently use Nikon DSLR system and was looking for something small and with unlimited creative abilities. Thats when I came across the CoolPix P7000. Its a powerhouse, every feature is included, every film speed, every flash setting. You have complete control over this camera. Flash output, slow sync, rear curtain, features that only pros would use. Image quality is excellent, even in low light situaitons. The camera is a bit bigger than one of those little digital cameras. Does not fit in your pants pocket, but does fit in a small bag or coat pocket. Comes with a Nikon strap. The point is, if you are looking for a simple point and shoot with poor image quality this is not the camera for you. If you are in search for a semi pro camera with a suberb image quality and don&apos;t feel like luggi ... ng around a large DSLR system, then look no longer, P7000 is fantastic. Read the reviews and more inportantly read the very thick manual. It also shoots RAW format, very nice indeed. 10/10 Nikon really did good job on this little camera....

     <Review>Pros: 720P Video; Focus and zoom in video; 7X Optical Zoom

I&apos;ve been searching for a high end point and shoot for an upcoming European adventure. I hadn&apos;t purchased a digital camera since October 2000. I began my search looking at the G12 and the S95, both from Canon. Fine cameras and very highly regarded. Its my intention to use this camera to shoot video as well as stills. 720p obviously isn&apos;t the highest video resolution available, but certainly is good enough for my purposes. Here&apos;s a couple of things that tipped the scales in favor of the P7000. 1. 7x optical zoom. 2. Full zoom and focus in the video mode. Most cameras in this range have fixed focus and zoom in video mode.</Review>

     <Review>I had this camera for a week. It is having high quality images but somehow very slow either on shutter action and on saving the raw images. Hand touches and feeling are all good. The lens moves fast and quite. The image quality is very impressive. Low light performance is also pretty impressive. Video function is very convenient especially allows me to zoom while taking the video clips and the video quality is very good. First day my good 16GB Panasonic SD card was damaged after inserted in. Formatting went OK but after taking a few pictures it reported card access failure and after that I can not use that card anywhere - indicating the error message and won&apos;t access the card anymore. It also lock up itself a few times that I had to pull out battery to reboot it. I also had a difficult t ... ime to quickly capture images like I used to. Had to return it.

     <Review>Great little camera for when I don&apos;t feel like lugging my D700 (with battery grip and f/2.8 lenses) around. The menus are a little hard to figure out how to navigate, and setting options isn&apos;t always intuitive, but it&apos;s a great little camera with great image quality and good low-light capabilities. It would be nice if it were a big smaller so it&apos;d fit more comfortably in a jacket pocket, but that would probably sacrifice more important things. The lag in between shots is a bit long (but I&apos;m also shooting fine-quality RAW files, so that probably slows things down). Much better, especially in low light, than the P5000 this camera is replacing for me.</Review>

     <Review>Bought the camera for an upcoming vacation. Wanted a camera small enough to carry but still give great results. Will use for outside sports shots. The idea of a good 200 mm lens on a compact camera was a strong selling point. Also used for some inside sporting events - have gotten acceptable results with 800-1600 ISO and not extending over 100mm. The range finder is very handy for the bright light or shooting burst mode. Have used digitals from compacts to DSLRs. Find this best for me. This remind me of my 50&apos;s vintage Contax.</Review>

     <Review>Having been a Canon SLR shooter for 20+ years I took a brief rather painful foray into the digital SLR world circa 2005 I was very unimpressed with the images I took and the colors were terrible and I sorta sold all my equip and walked away in disgust fast forward 5 years and I hear a review of these new pro level digital compacts that gave you manual controls, and outstanding images. After a little bit of research I chose the Nikon P7000, and I must say I have been a VERY happy little shutter bug since then. First of all the build quailty on this camera at this price is superb, the retro-style reminds me so much of the range-finders of the 70&apos;s and 80&apos;s then lets get to the 3.0 view screen WOW! One of the things I couldn&apos;t tolerate on my old Canon was the murky unreadable screen, P7000&apos; ... s is a champ! and you will need that bright screen for the manual focus, yes manual focus on a compact, add that to the manual shutter and apeture controls and it&apos;s like my old F1 lives again. Now onto the inner workings, this thing allows SO MUCH in-camera processing of images it boggles the mind. You really are in complete control of this camera its a miracle. What has really blown me away is the low light hand held capabilities of this thing I never in my life have been able to get the number of usable low light images hand held as I have in the last couple of weeks. The control dials are all very intuative and easy to use, and the little pop-up flash does a really good job within 5 to 6 ft of the subject. Now are there things I&apos;d like to see? sure exposure info in the viewfinder would be nice, push to select on the thumb wheel too. Since every review MUST have a con, I suppose if this thing lacks anywhere it is in low light in program mode where the AF tends to hunt and hunt for focus and also wants a wider angle aspect to obtain focus your not getting any epic tight shots even with the flash (but with this many pixels you can crop) All in all a top-notch 5 Star effort from Nikon that delivers crisp rich images with all the bells and whistles AND manual control you could ever ask for in a compact. They may have finally brought me back to photography and gained a new lietime customer to boot

     <Review>I&apos;m a photojournalist who shoots with all Nikon DSLR gear and had been waiting for a decent compact to carry with me at all times. Because I shoot RAW and use an NEF-Centric workflow (with Photo Mechanic and Capture NX2) I didn&apos;t want to get the Canon G series and have to create a different workflow. Already I got a couple of cover-worthy shots that I wouldn&apos;t have because I had it in my vest pocket while my big gear was packed away. It&apos;s important to download the newest Firmware (v 7.1) which greatly increases the RAW processing time. Otherwise, it&apos;s agonizingly slow. The lens, LCD monitor and build quality are excellent, and I have all the control I need. Yes, there is some occasional hang-up with auto-focus, and the optical view finder is not ideal, but if you&apos;re a Nikon shooter l ... ike me, you&apos;ll find this to be a great addition to your camera bag.

     <Review>Note: My review assumes you are familiar with shooting RAW (or at least what it is) and are looking for a camera with advanced features. This camera is LONG overdue. I have been waiting for an advanced Nikon P&amp;S for many years now, something that I could have with me most of the time. A few years ago I got tired of waiting and being disappointed by the Nikon offerings that were supposedly competing in this niche of the market. Completely frustrated, I broke down and bought a Canon G9. It has served me well but was always a source of frustration when I needed supplemental lighting. You see, although I did break down and purchase a Canon camera, I refused to buy a Canon speedlight for this camera, the only Canon product I own, when I own several SB-900s and SB-600s that I use for locati ... on work. Finally, when one day (without warning) I was asked to just take a few pictures at an event my wife was attending, I just got fed up with my inability to shoot with an off-camera speedlight. Still refusing to invest in more gear for my only Canon camera, I decided to try the P7000. I find the operation of this camera to be very similar to my G9. The P7000 is slightly taller and a few controls are slightly different, but no big learning curve here. For me, most of the changes are INSIDE the camera. I will focus primarily on those features from here on out. -I find the menu much more intuitive. While lacking some of the options I was hoping for (Copyright notices you can have added to the metadata, CLS support......after all, isn&apos;t this supposed to be a pro&apos;s P&amp;S?), I do find it much easier to use than the G9&apos;s which still feels like it is written in a foreign language. -Low-light ASA/ISO is much better than the G9. I am finding noise levels at ISO 3200 to be about the same as what you would get at ISO 800 on the G9. Now, this is to be expected as the P7000 is a few generations newer. However, if you are a D3 series shooter, the P7000&apos;s ISO 3200 will seem very noisy. -Not sure how big of a problem this will be for most P7000 shooters but it does have a new RAW format. Instead of the .NEF format we all know, Nikon has this camera using an .NRW format. If you keep up-to-date on all of your software, you will be fine. However, older software will not even recognize the file extension. -RAW files are slow to write. Nikon has used a big enough buffer that it does not lock up the camera (anyone remember awful the 5400 was?) but you often get the please wait for image to record message if you try to preview right after exposure. All-in-all, I like it better than my G9, which I also liked. The P7000 has better image quality and is more compatible with my Nikon accessories. It falls short of what I am used to from my FX bodies and I doubt it is quite as good as the G12, but is now my new carrying around camera.

     <Review>This is not a point and shoot camera even though you can use it that way. I feel like I am using a mini-dslr. A mode dial, compensation dial, ISO, WB and bracket settings are at your fingertips without having to get into a lot of menus. I have used this camera for general purpose and family photos and find it to be fun to use. You can even attach the SB800 to it, although it looks a little top heavy. The SB400 looks like it was made for the camera to me as far as size. I had purchased the Panasonic LX-5, which is a very nice camera, but found it too small for me. The P7000 fits me well and seems well built. I have gotten some very nice photos even in low light. Just don&apos;t expect to put in in your shirt pocket. A coat pocket or maybe cargo pants pocket would work pretty well. I recommend th ... is camera for a nice walk around camera without the hassle of a lot of weight.

     <Review>I was so excited when Nikon announced the P7000 that after playing with it at the recent PDN show in NYC, I bought one a couple of days later. I had been looking at the Canon G12 and if Nikon hadn&apos;t released the P7000, I might have gone with the Canon. The main difference is that the Canon has a movable viewing screen which, while convenient for some shooting situations, was not important enough for me to be a deal breaker. Besides, I&apos;d been using Nikon since the late 70&apos;s, I was happy to be able to stay in the Nikon family. I have 3 primary uses for this camera ... travel, every day grab shots, and as a back-up camera when I&apos;m on a job shooting candids and groups. It&apos;s built well and feels substantial and comfortable in your hands. It has an ED glass lens with a decent zoom range (7x ... ), impressive picture quality, RAW capture, a ton of adjustments - most of which are accessible without going into the on-screen menu. In macro mode, you can focus down to about 3 inches from your subject. In a pinch I&apos;ve used it to record video. The video quality is pretty good and the external mic input helps you capture really clean audio. Audio level control is automatic and does a decent job. One other thing that impressed me is it&apos;s ability to capture clean images at high ISO. I&apos;ve shot candids with it at 1600 and the pictures look great. I have no problem recommending this camera to a friend, colleague, or anyone else.

     <Review>I am a great fan of Nikon DSLRs, starting with a D1 that I purchased in December of 1999. But I have been constantly disappointed by their compact point-and-shoots. The P7000 is no exception. 1) The auto white balance produces unappealing results under compact flourescents. Whereas a Canon SD800 produces flawless colors under the exact same conditions. 2) Despite the dial with ISO on the P7000, it takes so long for the ISO selection to appear on the screen that it is confusing and frustrating. 3) The review time is 2 seconds or nothing. It cannot be lengthened. Whereas, on the Canon G12, SD800 and likely most of the Canon point-and-shoots, the review time can be adjusted, and, even better, the just-taken image will remain on the monitor as long as you keep the shutter button held dow ... n after a shot. 4) The self timer cannot be set to more than 10 seconds, whereas the Canon G12 can be set for anything from 2 to 30 seconds. I find that I often cannot get into a photo within 10 seconds. I am sad that Nikon missed on these features. I would have had liked to have a compact camera compatible with my existing Nikon flashes, but I am returning the P7000.

     <Review>I use this camera as my carry everywhere pocket camera. I regularly donate my services as photographer to volunteer groups involved in outdoor recreation and or conservation. This camera is great for the purpose intended. The options are vast and thus the learning curve is steep. The dials controlling the various functions are easy to use and well placed. One has to practice enough to memorize their function. Many of my photographs are candid portraits in the field and the record feature is a huge bonus. No more juggling camera, notebook, tools, etc in the wind. I push the button and record the subject&apos;s information. So what&apos;s the beef? I found out in the field (too late to return the camera) the lens cover was not fully retracting. That is a huge flaw! not being to turn on the camera a ... nd start shooting. Gripe number 2:the User&apos;s Manual or, Manual del usuario, the language doesn&apos;t make a difference, same kid probably translated both Spanish or English equally perplexing, the Spanish reads better. I read the Manual at bedtime-puts me right to sleep.

Cons: Lag / Shutter Delay

Great low light images! Easier to carry than DSLR. NRW RAW format is not readable by Adobe software. It must be edited with Nikon software (supplied w/camera). Hopefully, Adobe will develop this capacity for their Camera RAW suite.</Review>

     <Review>Great camera for the serious amateur or pro looking for a versatile camera when not wanting to lug your DSLR around. Great size &amp; weight to stick in your pocket, but enough settings to totally control your image, not just a bunch of modes. Been waiting for a point &amp; shoot with a viewfinder.</Review>

     <Review>In a previous review I stated that this camera has one useful feature in an articulating LCD. I was wrong: It does not have this useful feature. Sorry for the confusion. The camera itself does not live up to its potential in any aspect: It is slow-handling and has a next-to-useless optical viewfinder. It must be held at arm&apos;s length like Mom does for shots of the kids, definitely not like someone trying to do street photography. An articulating LCD would partially rectify this problem. The controls are fiddly-small and often can&apos;t be used in bright sunlight without a hood for the screen. If you&apos;re serious about your photography then buy something else.</Review>

     <Review>OK, it doesn&apos;t have the articulating screen and the second command dial as P7100 but for a lot less, I can live with it. Firmware 1.2 fixes pretty much all the software issues that plagued this much maligned but capable camera. It should really help Nikon and the vendors move the remaining stock of this unloved camera. For me, although I am a Nikon guy, I held out to the bitter end and at one point even considered purchasing a G12, until the price drop and the firmware update. I am extremely happy with this purchase and the performance improvement.</Review>

I bought this camera last June 6, 2011 &amp; used it during my vac in Czech Rep on Aug 2011 but the Zoom Malfunction! It wouldn&apos;t go back in! I tried taking-out the battery, same thing! Good thing there was a Nikon Service Center in Prague &amp; brought it there. However, after fixing it, the Shutter Window wouldn&apos;t open fully that my pictures gets shadows on the corners! Wanted to return this product but Adorama wouldn&apos;t take it back because they say it is out of Warranty! I tried contacting Nikon USA &amp; told me it&apos;s a GRAY MARKET! Now, I am left with a dysfunctional camera nobody wants!</Review>

     <Review>Pros: All good...

Cons: Not neatly pocketable...

I must confess to returning this camera a coupla weeks back when I learned its successor the P7100 was coming out in late September.

I&apos;m a lifelong Nikon shooter and working professional. So when it came time to buy a pocket camera, Nikon was my choice.

The P7000 is a great camera especially now that it has come down a bit in price. Solidly made with more features than the average &quot;picture taker&quot; would ever need.</Review>

     <Review>Well, being a fan of Nikon SLRs and a user for several years, it pains me to have to write a review like this... I carry a &apos;point-and-shoot&apos; camera, primarily as a back-up, but also in situations where an SLR is too bulky (especially the family vacation) to carry. I use it primarily for snap shots, but also for serious work (landscape/portraits/macro). Although I don&apos;t use raw files often on these, I like to have the option available. In the past I have used the Canon G-series, because tbey out performed Nikon and were quicker to navigate. I thought this might have changed with the introduction of the P7000, at least that is what I surmised from all of the reviews. When it came time to upgrade, I hesitantly purchased the P7000. I have used this camera on two separate occasions; one w ... ord describes it, and that word is slow. Slow to start-up; slow to respond; slow to refresh, slow to write (reg. files); slow to focus (if it does focus). Don&apos;t get me wrong, this is a nice p&amp;s camera, and does have its positives, but not what you would expect from an advanced camera. This model has not changed my view of Nikon p&amp;s cameras and I will not be keeping it.

     <Review>I think I love this camera, but I&apos;m not sure. I only got to use it for a week and a half before I had to pack it up and send it back to Nikon for repairs. I bought it as a light weight companion to my DSLR and was not let down by the functionality, the picture quality, the control, or the fun. Takes great photos. The problem is, after one week of pampered use, the &apos;lens cover&apos; began to get stuck at ~50% open when I turned on the camera. This is pretty inexcusable since my 5 year old Canon SD450 still works like a champ and has been to the top of Mt. Fuji, carried daily for over a year, and tossed and shaken around on several trips. So it&apos;s been with Nikon now for about 3 weeks, and it seems like it may be there for another 2-3 more. I&apos;m not happy. Love the CAMERA, worried about the ... quality of the lens cover and if this will happen again in the future when it&apos;s out of warranty and leave me stuck with a camera that needs to be manually open, when what I wanted was a quick draw. Honestly, if I have to flick the lens covers open with a lens pen or something each time I turn the camera on, this camera is of no use to me. Search the message boards to see if people have the same issues with the Canon G12.

     <Review>Pros: DSLR functionality

Cons: defective firmware and workmanship.

Purchased this camera before doing research on the web. I have the Nikon D90 and it performs flawlessly, and looked to purchasing a point and shoot camera. The P7000 had perks of an SLR in a point and shoot package. The first P7000 i got had focusing issue in every setting, MASPnAuto, Macro, AF, and infinity. I exchanged the camera for another one and had the same issues. I called Nikon customer service and they had me update the firmware from ver1.0 to ver1.1. The update only removed the &quot;initializing lens, cannot focus&quot; warning, but it still had the same focusing issues. I went online and did a search for &quot;P7000 issues&quot; and found that it was a common issue with other users, along with a dysfunctional lens co ... ver.
Nikon makes great cameras, but this particular model is a huge disappointment. :(

     <Review>The camera takes wonderful pictures when it works. The lens cover sticks and does not open fully. Nikon has refused to cover this issue under warranty although the camera is only 7 months old and the issue is clearly documented on several forums. The camera also has had focus issues and freezes up with the only resolution to remove and reinsert the battery. The focus and freeze up issues continued after updating the firmware. Stay away from this one.</Review>

     <Review>I have had the P7000 for just over 2 weeks and am very pleased with this purchase. The camera feels sturdy and is a pleasure to hold. I have only shot JPEGs and they look awesome straight out of the camera. I have shot at f/2.8 at ISO 6400 and the noise is very acceptable. Set-up and menus are very sraight-forward. If you have used any Nikon DSLR you won&apos;t have any problems. Controls are very user friendly and logically placed. At the current lower price the P7000 is a steal!</Review>

     <Review>I wanted a small fully functioned camera with good low light capability to take along whwn I didn&apos;t want to tussle with my DSLR. I originally shopped for something with an APS C size sensor. The mirrorless offerings were tempting but just too pricey for my largely point &amp; shoot application. The Fujifilm X100 was really interesting but numerous reported quirks put me off. In the end, it came down to the D7000 and the equivalent Canon. As I have the Nikon DSLR, I know their system. I have the Nikon flashes, and the I like the longer lens. When I saw the price B&amp;H offered, I went for it. It is a very capable camera which produces wonderful images - BUT - it is so sloooooowwwww... in operation that sometimes you just want to shake it! It has often been said that the best camera ... is the one you take with you. I&apos;ve found myself carrying this one along when I wouldn&apos;t have brought the full DSLR gear.

     <Review>Quality like a Reflex, but small like a compact. I found all the functions used with my old N70 in the new P7000, but the results are better (digital images are really better!). I had only some problems about the auto focus in particular with poor light.</Review>

     <Review>This camera gives you good results overall. While it&apos;s not a shirt-pocket camera, it is easy to carry around at all times; a good alternative to lugging the DSLR around or going without. It seems a little slow in reading some light situations and the autofocus is also a little slow on occasion. The zoom lens allows you to reach out relatively far for a compact, but at f/2.8, it isn&apos;t the best low light camera on the market. It is easy to adjust settings and the pictures (RAW) are great.</Review>

     <Review>I keep this camera with me at all times. It&apos;s great for capturing the moment with my kids, grandkids and great grandkids. Moments I&apos;d miss because I do not have my DSLR available. It takes great pictures at a resolution I can easily print large enough for my piurposes. Sometimes I wish it would focus faster, but that has not been a show stopper for me. Highly recommended for a general purpose, pocket camera.</Review>

     <Review>Steep learning curve. Takes quite a bit of time to master, and it does have its quirks. But you will not find a better all-around, small form camera. Exceptional quality at ISO 100 and very usable imaging as high as ISO 1600, which is remarkable for a small-sensor cam. I would not recommend the P7000 to the casual shooter who simply wants to press a button. This is a camera for the experienced enthusiast or pro who knows how to take a good picture with any camera but who wants full control and flexibility in a near-pocket size tool. In that respect, it succeeds better than any small-sensor camera I have owned to date. At base ISO, the image quality is indistinguishable from my larger, heavier, costly Nikon and Canon DSLRs.</Review>

     <Review>I take most of my pictures in macro to be posted on my web site. After reading professional reviews and comparing photo&apos;s from both the Nikon P7000 and the Canon G12, I chose the P7000. Why, because they are close enough to each other, I simply couldn&apos;t justify paying over $100.00 more for the Canon. If the price tag was equal, it would be the Canon G12, but they&apos;re not equal. I have a hard time understanding why some reviews stated no view finder It&apos;s right there on BOTH cameras! Neither the Nikon or the Canon have a 100% acurate view finder. Complaints are also noted about shutter lag. This inherant on both brands. If shutter lag is a problem, one would be better off purchasing a DSLR. Concerning the built in flash: neither the Nikon or the Canon are worth much of anything. S ... olution, get an external flash. For my purpose, it all boiled down to price and picture quality. The Canon IS slightly better in certian areas, but my pocketbook screamed less when I purchased the Nikon P7000. If price is no object, get the Canon G12. It&apos;s as simple as that!

     <Review>Fantastic capabilities and features in a compact unit. Flexible and fully controllable for those wanting to influence their photography while retaining the ease of use that point and Shoot users will find fun. For this last group the easy options of the Scenes options offers additional easy to use capabilities. Would like a buffer or internal memory capable of shooting Continuous in RAW format but that is a minor gripe compared to all of what the P7000 offers in such a compact package. I compared long and hard against the Cannon G12 and went with the P7000 mainly because of the better zoom and faster lens the latter offered. Also I was influence by the fact that I own several Nikon DSLRs and had many accessories that would mate well with the P7000 The P7000 has excellent low light ca ... pabilities and its image quality is superb.

     <Review>I am a Nikon DSLR shooter for many years. My main camera is a D700. I love the controls and picture quality of this camera. I wanted something smaller for portability and the option to shoot RAW,add being able to use Nikon speed lights and it is a winner. Overall I have been very pleased but there is a learning curve with this camera.</Review>

     <Review>I bouught this camera to have as a backup for my Nikon D700 to use it both when I have the camera and when I don&apos;t wish to lug it around. The camera does an amazing job for its size and the photos are very sharp. The program modes for closeups etc. work extremly well. I&apos;m glad I bought it and have used it on walks to document architecture ad nature on walks. The hot shoe makes it easy to utilize the speedlight. Great Camera, I wish the zoom was somehow non electronic as I find it difficult to stop at the point I want and either have too much or too little zoom, but compared to other point and shoot cameras, this one is a winner. I did hot buy it for the video, and have not tried this feature.</Review>

     <Review>Pros: Picture quality

Cons: a bit larger than normal point and shoot camera&apos;s

I purchased this camera as a secondary small (compact) alternative to my big DSLR and I have to say. It&apos;s one of the best picture quality camera&apos;s I&apos;ve owned. It lives up to my expectations and more for a bit larger than a normal point and shoot. Well worth the extra size and money.</Review>

     <Review>Good pictures require great stability regardless of what camera is used. This bracket is smoothly finished and highly versatile. It enables using the P-700 on an Arca Swiss type/Kirk quick release in any position, i.e. vertical, horizontal and in between. The bracket has an extra 1/4-20 threaded hole so the camera can be mounted on any device without removing the L-braket. Also the bracket does not impair removal or insertion of either a battery or a memory card. Finally, the L-bracket does allow vertical positioning with the on-board flash above the lens.</Review>

     <Review>Nikon&apos;s P7000 records Apple QT files when shooting video clips. This crucial fact is [...] not mentioned on the Nikon web site!So, if you ever want to actually watch the video you just shot on a Windows PC, you need to download and install the QT Player for Windows from the Apple web site first, yuck!! And then, all you get for free is their stripped-down QT player that shows the video with the frame around it, in less than full screen size. If you want to watch the video in full screen, as you can easily do with the Windows Media Player, then you need to give money to Apple for an upgraded QT Pro player. Yuck again!!I called Nikon Tech Support this morning about this little trick of theirs, and got connected to a chap who spoke the world&apos;s poorest English. Also, he did not know ANYTHING. ... After 20 minutes on the phone, he finally suggested I contact Microsoft Corporation and ask them for a solution to play the QT files using Windows Media Player. I kid you not!We have another Nikon CoolPix that records AVI video clips, no problems to report with that one. Nikon must be taking good cash from Apple now.[...]

     <ReviewTitle>Nikon P7000 for Traveling</ReviewTitle>
     <ReviewDate>Feb 23, 2011</ReviewDate>
     <RatingHTML>&lt;div class=&quot;rsw-stars-small&quot; title=&quot;4 stars (Liked it)&quot; ga:type=&quot;UserRating&quot;&gt;  &lt;div class=&quot;rsw-starred&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;rsw-starred&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;rsw-starred&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;rsw-starred&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;rsw-unstarred&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;</RatingHTML>

     <Review>Pros: Screen is very sharp; Convenient flash; Manual focusing works; Excellent macro photos; Quality photos; Fast Focus; Good low-light capability; Videos are decent; Zoom has good range; Many options; Video sound is good

Cons: Flash a little weak; Touchy zoom speed; Awkward strap eyelets; Need to study manual; A little slow on 2nd shot; Smallish shutter release

I bought the P7000 as a travel camera for work and leisure as an upgrade to a Nikon 995. I have a D70 that is too bulky for most travel. The P7000 takes very sharp photos, and I liked the close-up macro capability, especially when documenting samples during factory or field visits. The image quality is excellent, though I feel the need to slightly push the exposure by +1/2 or +1 to get better detail in the shadows. ... 

I have a couple of external Nikon flashes (SB-25 and SB-800). The SB-25 did not work at all; the flash would not fire. The SB-800 was not automatically recognized by the P7000 on &quot;auto&quot;, but when I manually set the P7000 to one of the flash modes, it worked fine. The P7000 seems to set the &quot;auto ISO&quot; by metering without the flash, so it is good to manually set the ISO to avoid grain in the resulting images. 

I found it necessary to study the manual to reach some of the subtle features that weren&apos;t obvious to me from the camera&apos;s menus. Overall, I am pleased with the camera.

     <Review>We use this camera for quick product shots of jewelry and home good for our etsy shop. it&apos;s fairly easy to use, although we had some help with the basics from a photographer friend. We&apos;re not photographers at all, just needed a nicer camera than we had. It&apos;s nice and small so we can bring it along anywhere for personal use also. We LOVE the video quality. Being able to plug a mic in is great, also. For some reason, the black piece that opens in front of the lens when you turn on, sometimes gets stuck at the bottom and you just have to tap it to go back into place. I&apos;m going to call about this though as I bought the warranty.</Review>

     <Review>This camera feels and functions more closely to a DSLR than I had expected. Most of the controls are intuitive and in general have found that this camera is really sophisticated for a compact even with good shutter response time. I wish that the viewfinder covered more of the capture. I only wish it were a little smaller. A little lighter would have been nice but the size makes putting it in a pocket rather difficult. I understand there is a case which I assume would fit on a belt but no one seems to have it.</Review>

     <Review>This is a wonderful camera. Not just as a point and shoot but any camera. I&apos;ve used a Canon G9 for about three years and did a lot of reading and decided to get the P7000 as they finally made a p&amp;s to compete with Canon. Very pleased with the G9 but it was weak in low light and very noisey. The P7000 is outstanding in that area. Also the zoom, although not quite as long as my G9 in the long end, gives me 28 compared to G9&apos;s 35 mm. The G9 has a few features I wish the P7000 had, but no big deal. A hybrid of the two would be unreal. Hope it happens by one of the two giants. Now the problem: I read in several reviews that the lens protector could get hung up and not fully open when you activated the camera. After about two weeks and many, many open and closes and over a thousand shots, it ... happened to me!. My G9 NEVER did it. Nikon has got to get this annoying problem fixed. It&apos;s obviously a design flaw[...] All in all I love the camera and will exchange it and hope my new one won&apos;t develop this problem. I would definitely recommend this camera.

     <Review>I&apos;ve only owned the camera for 2 full days now, but I&apos;m already impressed. I haven&apos;t found anything to dislike about it yet, if I ever will, but I am writing from a position of not much use yet. I had originally intended to buy the Canon Powershot G12 before I checked to see if Nikon had something similar, whereupon I found this - basically the same camera as the G12, but for $55 less at B&amp;H. That plus the more powerful zoom pushed me to buy it, and I haven&apos;t been disappointed. It is exactly the size, shape and weight I expected it to be - more substantial than the average point and shoot, but much less so than a DSLR. The controls and menu items are easy and intuitive, particularly if you&apos;re familiar with Nikon cameras already. The start-up time and lag times are minimal; in fac ... t, the lag, if any, isn&apos;t perceptible. It&apos;s easy to use manual controls, and the automatic functions are really good. I generally try to avoid using a flash whenever possible, so I did a lot of shooting in the P mode (Program) with auto everyhthing and also with the ISO set to 400, then 800, and with the light meter compensation or whatever it&apos;s called set to -1. They all came out very good, with the 800 ISO ones being granier, as one would expect. The lighting came out great; the pictures were clear and in focus, and I could not be happier. If you buy this camera, the chances are you&apos;ll be pleased

     <Review>I bought two P7000&apos;s at Christmas for grown daughters who aspire to take good photographs. One is somewhat experienced, the other a novice. With each passing week, I&apos;m more pleased with this decision. This is a camera that can grow with the owner. In automatic operation, it produces excellent results in most shooting situations. Low light or high contrast situations have presented the opportunity to learn, one or two features at a time. My point is: this is an excellent tool for the beginner that doesn&apos;t limit them as their skills increase. Not to mention it reflects every bit of the build quality you expect from Nikon, unlike some of the lower-end Coolpix models available. There is a genuine need for a superior quality digital camera for the shooter that doesn&apos;t want to get invol ... ved in the complexity or bulk of a DLSR system, and the P7000 is an outstanding execution of the genre.

     <Review>I bought this camera for one SINGLE REASON: It comes with an optical view finder. The prize was also hard to beat. I resisted digital for as long as I could. So naturally I have issues with the LCD most of the time. When I saw this product I knew it was for me. It turned out to be a pleasure to use and I am very pleased with its Low Light performance. There is much talk about its slow user inter face and the time it takes to write RAW images. I have to say that since I don&apos;t shoot raw , this is no problem for me. As far as it&apos;s speed in handling user commands--I suppose there are faster cameras out there, but in reality most of us will not notice it. One can update its firmware from Nikon&apos;s site if that will help. I have found the video image is not as good as one would hope, mainly the ca ... mera is constantly adjusting its white balance and as a result the video clip is always switching between either too bright or too dark. So for video I use my Lumix DMC-ZS3. I think it is also worth to say that this camera looks bigger on the web than its actual size when you hold it in your hands. So those of you who might think that it is too big can relax a bit. Gave four stars because of video quality.I am very happy with it and I have been a B&amp;H customer for a long time. Two thumbs up!

     <Review>I am a pro photographer and loyal to Nikon, and was looking for a &apos;point and shoot&apos; camera that i could use my nikon flashes on. The P7000 is that and more. It has a solid body and feels like a classic nikon camera. The color balance and exposures are amazing, and the plethora of shooting options does not take away from the camera&apos;s user friendly interface.The only complaints I have is that it takes a couple second to process raw files before you can shoot again. This pause is very brief when shooting in jpg mode though. The delay from pressing the shutter to capture is almost non-existant otherwise, very good for this kind of camera. I would also love a fixed aperture of 2.8, but that is mostly unheard of in point and shoots.I also got it for the Hi-def Video, which is awesome as well. I ... haven&apos;t tried using an external mic yet but appreciate that capability and will definitely use it.I am overall quite pleased with this purchase, it has many of the features of a DSLR in a smaller and less obtrusive body.

     <Review>Although it has the requisite scene and auto modes this is definitely a camera for an advanced photographer. It&apos;s quite complex with a rather steep learning curve but once you get it figured out you can take excellent photos with it. I&apos;ve printed some to 12.5 x 19 that hold excellent detail and I probably could have gone further. It&apos;s not a fast camera by any stretch of the imagination, but if you don&apos;t shoot sports or require fast response it works well. The auto focus needs a lot of light to lock on, but the manual focus works well. I&apos;ve found that it focuses best in macro mode and manual focal point setting. Be sure to upgrade the firmware to 1.1 if it hasn&apos;t been done when you buy it as that will increase the raw write speed considerably.</Review>

     <Review>Pros: Lots of external controls; Macro; Focal distance

Cons: Speed

I&apos;ve hiked for a week in Patagonia and I enjoyed the versatility of this camera. I ended up taking a lot of macro photos of the flora and I was super impressed with the result - sharp photos even in poor light conditions. This is the perfect camera for backpacking/hiking and an excellent SLR backup. Even though it is not very fast at processing raw I did not find this to be a serious issue. 
I&apos;m actually between a 4 and 5 just because I had a problem with the lens cover not opening completely and I had to send it back for repair. I blame the crazy Patagonian winds for that.</Review>

     <Review>Pros: image quality , meaningful image controls

Cons: image noise at high iso , Menu Madness

1st up , upgrade the firmware to 1.1 and skip the speed issues reported from ver 1.0. Its a shame Nikon released the camera with firmware that was not ready for prime time. But the new firmware seems a good step toward making the P7000 a great shooter. I bought This to replace a 5400 that ive taken over 3000 photos with. These cameras can produce slr quality photographs if you are aware of the limitations of a 1.7 sensor (iso). I been using nikon cameras and lenses since the FM and FE days , they&apos;ve always produced a class act. Cutting the Noise on iso&apos;s over 800 and cleaning up the menu tree would be appreciated.. The toy gimmick functions are not for people who buy this class camera ... . Learning to use the collection of control buttons and dials will make it a lot easier to relate to

     <Review>The flash works remarkably well for such a small camera. The camera itself is very light and easy to hold. There is definitely a learning curve with all the different buttons and wheels, but if you are already familiar with Nikon it isn&apos;t too bad. Has some pretty cool shortcuts for frequent manual settings. Takes awesome pictures on auto. Excellent alternative to carrying a larger camera.</Review>

     <Review>I am practically a life long canon EOS user. This is my first nikon. I am favorably impressed so far. I refuse to buy cameras without viewfinders, but this camera does not get 5 stars due to 2 viewfinder deficiencies. First, you only see 80 percent of your picture. Second, there are no focal points visible through the viewfinder, so you cant tell what you are focusing on unless you look at the screen. So few machines have viewfinders, I suppose you take what you can get. I picked this over the G12 for longer optical zoom range. This beats the heck out of toting the SLR and long piece of glass around for times when you want portability and are not on a serious shoot.</Review>

     <Review>I&apos;ve been a Nikon user dating back to the old Nikon Photomic FTN days. I now use a couple of D3s and have a tidy sum invested in my Nikon system so naturally when the P7000 was released I saw it as the perfect small extra camera to throw in my bag or have with me when I wasn&apos;t working a job; you know just casual shooting. Purchased the camera and tested it for a 2 weeks. Outdoor shots were great. Indoor available light ... not too great. Of course with the built-in flash, indoor shots were better but limited unless I slapped on a speed light. Bottom line: This camera has all the bells and whistles and the lens is good but the focus is a bit slow and erratic, the view finder leaves a lot to be desired, and RAW processing is very slow. Decided that all I need is a point and shoot vs a s ... mall camera with DSLR-like options.So I returned the camera for something much smaller, no viewfinder, no RAW, etc. I bought the LUMIX DMC-ZS7 which is essentially the Leica V-LUX 20. Small, lots of options an an incredible Leica DC Vario-Elmar Aspherical lens.

     <Review>An overall amazing camera for a point and shoot. Requires firmware 1.1 to get all five stars though. The new update fixes focusing problems and slow RAW write speeds. Full manual mode leaves a bit to be desired but the other modes work great. I would use my D7000 for more serious shooting, but for a decent, lightweight companion to use for less important things, the P7000 fits perfectly. I don&apos;t recommend using it in super low light interior shots though, as this isn&apos;t what this Hybrid P&amp;S is intended for. The controls are perfect and the menus are easy enough to navigate for both the photographer stepping up from a basic P&amp;S and also an SLR user who wants a lightweight backup. Hot shoe is great to use a dedicated flash with, and the pop up flash works great as a fill flash. ... Zoom range is great as well.

     <Review>I love Nikon. I have been using the d300 since it came out and have never regretted my purchase. The P7000 takes very nice pictures...but there are two things that make it unusable for me. #1. I love to shoot raw, but the write time (even with a fast card) makes raw shooting a pain. It takes forever. #2. Auto focus is also painfully slow and inaccurate. Forget about shooting macro. Even with the spot auto-focus the camera simply refuses to focus on close subjects. If you keep trying to take the photo, the camera will eventually re-initialize leaving you to be faced with the same problem. That being said, I love the controls, low light performance, and overall build quality. If I shot mostly jpeg I might even consider keeping it...but alas, it&apos;s not for me. Instead, I purchased the ... Lumix LX5. My first panasonic camera and I&apos;m quite happy with it. But I do miss the Nikon build and all the great dials!

     <Review>The P7000 has worked flawlessly since I received it about 2 weeks ago. I am a professional photographer, so I like the fact that with a turn of a dial I can use the camera on Manual. In manual I like that I have a separate wheel to control both the shutter speed and aperture. The quality of the images is top notch. The only thing I have found that is lacking is the camera&apos;s ability to focus in low light. The 2 things that I might wish for on the next generation camera is an info display inside the viewfinder like an SLR. Without the info you have to turn the screen on to adjust the settings. The other thing I would like is the ability to move the focus points. Other than those small things, I have loved the camera. It is also easy for my wife to use. She just puts it on P and take ... s great images.

     <Review>Pros: Zoom-ability when making a video

Cons: a little big

Having once tried my hand at professional photography and using top-notch equipment, I was used to having all the bells and whistles, yet once I became a Nana, I just wanted a lightweight point-and-shoot to use.... After trying a host of small cameras, I decided I wanted to upscale a bit so I got the new Nikon P7000 and absolutely love it. It&apos;s lightweight, yet larger than a point-and-shoot. One feature I particularly like is the ability to zoom while making a video.... That&apos;s what sold me on this camera over than the Canon G12....</Review>

     <Review>I am skin doctor and need the camera for shooting skin diseases mostly portraits and macros, and publishing them on scientific magazines. I was thinking in buying a SLR camera but it is big, heavy, needs a macro lense and a ring flash, so it would be a lot more expensive. This camera is a perfect option because it is light, easy to move, easy to shoot, and has all the resources to shoot good enough pictures for publishing in medical magazines. I love it for macro pictures because the position of the flash doesn&apos;t provoke too much shadow on the subject. Also, the pictures already come with a 300 dpi resolution which is necessary for most of the magazines. For my professional use, I just miss a better resolution in movies to film skin surgery on full hd. So this camera a perfect option for ... doctors or dentists that need to shoot and publish pictures in scientific articles. Besides that is a great camera for recreational uses like shooting on trips and parties.

     <Review>I wanted so badly to love this little camera. The write times for files are too slow, the adjustments and the light meter in manual mode are temperamental and hard to see. I wanted this to be a contender to the canon G12, but I like the functionality of the G12 better, the focus and snap time are far better on the G12. I am a Nikon user so I liked it for the menu familiarity. The exposure adjustments were great as well. I wanted a small point and shoot but the more I used it the less I like it. Its not a horrible little camera but I just didn&apos;t love it like I wanted to. So its going back. I think I would still recommend the Canon G12 over this no matter how much I wanted Nikon to outshine the G12.</Review>

     <Review>Pros: Feature rich, full manual control

Cons: Interface, Slow, Build

The Nikon P7000 is what I&apos;ve been waiting for, for years... almost.

It&apos;s a great camera, but there were too many annoyances with it compared to the Canon G12.

First, the lens cover blades didn&apos;t always open all the way which would cause black areas on my photos if I didn&apos;t notice it.

Second, Nikon really missed the boat by not adding a control dial to the front of the camera like the G12. I find it much easier to use than the rotary dial on the back of the P7000.

Third, the operating system is slow. It response in relationship to aperture/shutter speed adjustment is lagging and the time from menue to taking a photo is also too cumbersome.

Fourth, I wasn&apos;t happy with the res ... ults of the flash (both on camera and off). The Canon seems to nail it better every time.

That said, the camera does produce very good results, but not consistantly enough for $500 when there is a better alternative out there (in my opinion).

     <Review>Excellent camera for those times when you don&apos;t want to be lugging around a real camera, such as airline travel, going to the theater or museum, going to dinner, etc. Excellent glass as expected from Nikon. Produces first class images. Has P, A, S, M exposure modes, plus exposure compensation controls. Lens zoom range covers just about any situation. Has fill flash with compensation controls. Compared with P5100/P6000, has more functions moved to dials and buttons, and away from the menus, which I prefer. Has manual focus, but this feature is probably too cumbersome to use in a street situation.</Review>

     <Review>I&apos;m giving this camera only 4 stars due to the built-in flash does not work and I will be taking to a Nikon authorized repair dealer to look at the camera per Nikon technical support. I have used the camera without flash and so far am happy with the photos. My favorite thing about the camera is all of the buttons on top and how easy it is to change settings using these buttons. I also have enjoyed the lens zooming to 200.</Review>

     <Review>Great all round compact camera. I bought this as a back-up when the size of my D3S isn&apos;t feasible. Extremely usable focal length and the option to shoot raw make it a real winner. While it doesn&apos;t quite have the tough as a brick feel like my D3S (then again, how many cameras really do?) I&apos;m so used to holding (this may in part, be due to the fact that it&apos;s much lighter!), the overall build quality is exceptional, especially for it&apos;s price point. Picture IQ is excellent, with a magnitude of different settings/variables available to take your shots with - many of which are accessible via dials/buttons externally, instead of searching for them in a menu (it really makes a difference when shooting in the field). My conclusion? Highly recommended main camera for the enthusiast/pro-sumer ... photographer, or a back-up camera for when the sheer size/weight of a DSLR/lens isn&apos;t practical. For the market this camera is aimed at, it really doesn&apos;t get much better.

     <Review>Pros: Nice Body Color; Small / Compact; Large Clear LCD

Cons: Poor autofocus; Poor build; Poor Image Quality; Poor lens

Let me make it clear: this is a real-world review, based on my personal opinions (right or wrong) and on visual evaluations of the files. No test charts involved here, no MTF measurements. As for the photographs, they are out-of-camera jpgs (I don&apos;t shoot RAW anymore, so I&apos;m not interested) viewed on a calibrated LaCie 321 monitor. This review only refers to the specimen in my possession.
Keep in mind that my approach to the P7000 is deeply biased by my two-years positive experience with the Canon G10. Therefore as soon as I unboxed the Nikon I could&apos;t help noticing that it weighs less than it looks. I was expecting a sturdy and rugged unit like the Canon ... . As a matter of fact most authoritative experts and reviewers have pointed up in the last weeks that the P7000 is almost a clone of its rival Canon G11, since both share the same sensor and size, as well as most features and specifications. Somebody even ironically calls it &quot;Powershot P7000&quot;.
The lesser weight is easily explained: whereas the top and the front plates are metal made, the bottom and the back are pure plastic (I know, it should be called &quot;polycarbonate&quot;). Fact is that despite its semipro-compact ambitions, the P7000 definitely feels plasticky. The three knobs on the top don&apos;t click firmly enough and tend to get inadvertently rotated, the wheelpad on the back is flimsier than in a $ 200 point&amp;shoot and the battery/card compartment cover is simply shameful. Briefly a very good design, both ergonomically and aesthetically (the camera is indeed goodlooking), spoilt by inadequate materials and manufacturing. Paradoxically, the P7000 lacks the gorgeous ruggedness of the Nikon pro and semipro DSLRs, and inherits the poor and unreassuring tactile experience of the Canon semipro and entry-level ones.
As soon as the &quot;on&quot; button is pressed, the unit is ready to shoot. And the 921.000 dots lcd monitor is a real treat: big, clear and crisp enough to venture a picture evaluation. Menus are well organized and easily understood, as usual at Nikon&apos;s. Nothing to do with the insane and obscure literature found in Canon&apos;s G series. The viewfinder is definitely more accurate than the one of my G10, but the latter is bigger and slightly clearer. The three control knobs are clever and very well positioned. Especially the exposure compensation dial: your forefinger and thumb naturally &quot;fall&quot; on it, making the expose-to-the-right job an easy task. By the way, whereas the istogram remains visible after focusing, the (very welcome) electronic spirit level inexplicably disappears. I don&apos;t know about you, but I definitely don&apos;t have a steady hand, so I&apos;d find a permanent level really helpful. I hope this issue will be addressed in an upcoming firmware update.
Speaking of focus, the P7000 has big troubles in focusing on bright sunny surfaces, even when they are well textured. In my one-day test, I experienced at least one focus failure over eight attempts. Three times the LCD screen got gray and a warning appeared to advice me that the lens was getting re-initialized. I have never seen anything like that before. It&apos;s a fault that Nikon MUST take care of. All the more so because, this shortcoming apart, the P7000 would be a fast and reactive camera, very suitable for street photography.
What about picture quality? A camera is all about taking photographs, after all. Well, the Nikon P7000 delivers too contrasty images with a low noise level. In my opinion (I&apos;m not an engineer) the overcontrast is due to an inherent lack of dynamic range. I noticed that the exposure meter has serious troubles in keeping the highlights within the clipping threshold. In other words, to avoid highlights burning, I had to underexpose (up to 1 IL and more) most of the shots I took during the test, whereas the G10 easily managed the same shots with no tweaking. Of course the underexposure caused a severe darkening of the lowlights. As I said, noise is low enough, and has that pleasant...

     <Review>Pros: Lightweight; Compact; Durable

Cons: None

I was surprised at first because the case was shipped flat. But after I took it off the cardboard display piece that is used to hang it on a rack at a camera store I was able to form it into shape and the camera fit perfectly. I had lens armour on the front and a screen protector on the back and it accomodated it perfectly. It is made of nice material, looked nice and for me, it was the perfect way to carry around my little Nikon P7000.</Review>

     <Review>Lots to learn, but that means there are many options available. I&apos;m not entirely happy with the zoom, I thought it was a little longer range, but the indoor photos are GREAT and so is the close up feature. There are so many different options for scenes... night, portrait, sports, beach, indoor- just to name a few.. the list is LONG and each one seems to help! Battery life, so far is good. (Battery and charger are INCLUDED which is a PLUS!)... and buying a spare battery always allows you to have power on hand!</Review>

     <Review>There is a P7100 version at twice the price, but it is not avaiable yet. This one fits the P7100 perfectly. So buy this one now. It has a leather exterior except for the body area under the front flap which is a black quilted fabric. The interior is a soft fabric. The clasps are 2 magnets embedded inside the flap cover. It attaches to your belt with a 2 leather loop. There is a small SD card pouch on the rear side of the interior. A well made, attractively finished product. Hard to beleive it is only [$]. it&apos;s successor is $38. It is ideal for carrying the camera with you. It is just a carrying case, not a camera bag.</Review>

     <Review>I wanted a full featured point and shoot camera type of camera with a viewfinder, as I shoot a lot of scenery and wildlife while backpacking in the mountains. DSLR&apos;s are too bulky to haul around and LCD screens tend to wash out in bright light. This camera is the best of both worlds, compact, has superior zoom capabilities, along with HD video.</Review>

     <Review>Pros: Small / Compact; Great HD movies; Great Zoom; Good Image Quality; Full Viewfinder; Good Image Stabilization

Cons: Overly complex; Not intuitive

Keep the manual handy in both the camera-bag and at the computer. This camera tries to do it all in a very small package. I found that there was a long learning curve and, after 9 months, there are still capabilities that I don&apos;t or can&apos;t use.

It should still be possible to select f-stops greater than f-8, but you cannot. It does work remarkably well in low-light and night situations, even under auto-modes. The small size is both a distinct advantage, and a curse. It is small enough to shoot inobtrusively and candidly but hard to adjust on-the-fly for optimal depth-of-field and image quality. It does try to compensa ... te with user-settable pre-set criteria.

All-in-all, a remarkable photo-engineering feat that has not failed me yet, except that I have purchased 4 separate factory supplied 3-rd party IR remote controls and none worked.

     <Review>I have owned Nikon products since the late 1960&apos;s. I have Nikon DSLR equipment, but wanted something by Nikon which I could take to work everyday; a small, yet full-featured Nikon. This P7000 has met or exceeded all my expectations. I take it with me everywhere I can, and am shooting a lot more than I was with the heavier and bulkier DSLR cameras. Any suboptimal photos are the result of operator error - not the camera. It is certainly worthy of the Nikon name.</Review>

     <Review>I bought this camera as an auxiliary to my Nikon D80. I am planning on going to some third world countries where weilding a large and expensive DSLR may not be the smartest thing to do. So far, the P7000 has fit that role well. It is compact and stores easily in a jacket pocket. Power-on time is good and I haven&apos;t experienced the slow AF that some others have commented on. However, I mainly shoot landscapes, so that isn&apos;t a big problem. File write times when shooting JPEG Fine + RAW are slow, but again I mainly photograph stationary objects. When shooting in JPEG Fine alone, write times are reasonable. I really dig the 5 shot bracket capability and the fact that once the bracket is set and the shutter pressed, all 5 shots occur quickly and without having to press the shutter for ea ... ch shot. I have processed a series of bracketed shots into very impressive HDR&apos;s. All in all, a great camera and I am happy with the decision to go with the P7000.

     <Review>For carrying the camera around it works good. It&apos;s a little bulky due to the size of the camera, so if you wear your shirt over your belt worn camera, you&apos;ll have rather large bulge there. I would only recommend two things to make this case better, put a small pouch on the end of the case to hold a spare battery (better yet, one on each end!) and the inside of the case is big enough for more than one SD card pocket, how about 2, 3, or even 4 pockets?</Review>

     <Review>I have used Nikon for years. I have a D70, D300, and D2X. I have now retired and was looking for a small camera that would perform. I am simply doing fun photography these days and needed a camera that I could carry with me at all times. I have found the P7000 to be just what I was looking for. The price was good and the quality has been great. I plan to purchase another one for my daughter. So far it has met my expecations. It not as fast as the D300 but the size makes up for it.</Review>

     <Review>As the title reads, I really want to love this camera, but its AF is turning into a deal breaker. After downloading the latest firmware, and hoping for an improvement, it&apos;s just not there. In anything but ideal lighting conditions, I continue to experience hit or miss AF. The firmware did take care of the lens error message, but it did not address the P7000&apos;s lack of AF ability. I absolutely love the camera&apos;s slew of manual buttons (although it&apos;s crying out for a dedicated ISO dial), even the aesthetic appeal of its rangefinder-like appearance. I already own a D90, so I was looking forward to using my SB-400 and IR remote. I e-mailed Nikon regarding the AF issues and their response was lackluster, best summarized by reminding me I have a 1 year warranty. Thanks. I read reviews of th ... is camera before I purchased so I was aware of the slow menus and general slow navigability, potential sticking lens cover and AF issues. I haven&apos;t experienced the sticking lens cover, and I can live with the slow UI. I suppose I just didn&apos;t fully accept the AF issues that I read about and was hoping they were overblown. Unfortunately they are not.

     <Review>Nearly sent this camera back after my initial few shots because of the known tweeks in the original firmware. Downloaded the new version 1.1 right online from Nikon and this camear turned into a dream machine. It&apos;s macro capabilities is mind blowing. Picture quality with the expeed2 sensor is amazingly good! Before purchasing just call and make sure the one they send you is with the current firmware and you&apos;re good to go! BEST Coolpix I&apos;ve ever used by far!!! Once you buy it, you won&apos;t put it down!!!</Review>

     <Review>I just received the camera about a week ago from this write up and so far have taking it to a photoshoot at the beach. I am really pleased with the results. Picture quality is very good (excellent when compared to other point and shoot) I think that for the price it was an excellent buy.</Review>

     <Review>I&apos;ve wanted a smaller format camera for those times when I don&apos;t want the extra overhead of carrying my normal D300 or D70 systems. The ability to shoot in RAW mode, spot metering, high video resolution, compact size, multiple shooting modes, and a wide optical zoom range were all individual requirements. I was willing to sacrifice one or two of those features, but with the P7000, I didn&apos;t have to sacrifice anything. Combine that with almost no shutter lag, this is perfect. Not only is this my casual shooting camera, it has also found a spot in my regular setup for those times where I just want to grab a quick shot and most of the gear is still packed up. Very good price, and an excellent feature set.</Review>

     <Review>I like the excellent picture quality and the good zoom range. The macro range is ok for me because I don&apos;t take pictures of very small objects. Focussing was sometimes problematic especially in the very near distance. A firmware update helped to improve the focussing.</Review>

     <Review>Remember those cases that wrapped around the camera and flipped down so you could take the shot. This case is as close as you will get for the P7000. Fit is OK, given the leather will stretch a little in use. Protection is adequate unless it&apos;s raining. I&apos;d add a couple of features if I was the supplier. One, a way of retaining the case to the camera when taking photos and two, a pull over waterproof cover. Then it would get 5 stars.</Review>

     <Review>Purchased to replace a Canon G11 I kicked under a car. Bought to use an SB400 flash because the one thing Canon can&apos;t get right is flash. Controls are hard to use and ergonomics is not good. You reset the exposure compensation on almost a daily basis. Picture quality is fine but it is such a slow camera to use that it is almost useless. Slow focus, slow processing time, slow recycle, if speed is an issue, stay away from this. Nikon just can&apos;t seem to get point and shoot right. (I use only Nikon DSLR&apos;s... D70, D200, D300, D700, D2, D2H)</Review>

     <Review>Was looking for a camera with a view finder option so I didn&apos;t have to rely on rear display in bright light. Nice surprise, P7000 fits the bill and provides capability you would only expect from a higher end SLR. Battery life is great, solid performance in low light. Remarkable amount of flexibility. Strongly recommended.</Review>

     <Review>I bought this camera to use between my D50 and CoolPix 230. I wanted some of the features on a DSLR and a point and shoot. Now I grab the P7000 instead of one of the others as it takes as good or better pictures as the D50 and is much faster and takes much better pictures than the 230. I am still learning to use all the features. I would give this camera at lest 6 stars!!! It is expensive but every cent!!!</Review>

     <Review>I am planning a trip with my wife to South Africa with a couple day stop in Amsterdam. I did not want to have a heavy camera with multiple lenses to keep up with so decided on the P7000 because of the many features and ease of use. It is great for close up shots as well as ones taken at a reasonable distance. So far the photos I have taken are excellant and the clarity is superb. I will have a few months to experiment and learn prior to the trip. I hope to have many recorded photos during this trip of a lifetime. DM</Review>

     <Review>The bottom line is that this camera may have taken me out of the DSLR market. Compared to the compacts that I have been shooting with, the images are stunning. It does an amazing job in low light situations. The shutter lag is indiscernable. It fits in my pants pocket. It has bracketing (3 or 5 shots) which manufacturers have taken out of the lower end models. It can shoot RAW. My only reservation is the limited optical zoom of 7X. Great camera!</Review>

     <Review>I AM AN ADVANCED PHOTO ENTHUSIAST AND HAVE USED DSL, DIGITAL DSL, AND POINT AND SHOOT CAMERAS FOR 60 YEARS AND THIS IS THE MOST DISAPPOINTING CAMERA I HAVE EVER PURCHASED. TO MANY MEANINGLESS FUNCTIONS THAT WORK IN ONLY CERTAIN MODES. THE ZOOM AND FOCUS IS SLOW AND ERRATIC. SOME TIMES THE FOCUS AND ZOOM WILL NOT FUNCTION UNLESS CAMERA IS TURNED OFF THEN BACK ON. NIKON TRIED TO PUT TO MUCH INTO WHAT IS JUST ANOTHER POINT AND SHOOT.</Review>

     <Review>I purchased this camera as a backup to my Nikon D3, to have with me for the just in case shot. Unfortunately, while its image is sharp, the lag time for the shutter is very, very long. The controls are also not well thought out, requiring constant checking with the instruction manual</Review>

     <Review>I love this camera, I&apos;m always with camera the p7000 has the compact size of a point and shoot and many of the features of the bulky SLR. When I don&apos;t feel like the bulk of the SLR the p7000 is with me. The sensor is above the point and shoots and it has the option of RAW and JPEG.</Review>

     <Review>I was looking for a camera that I could carry with me most of the time. I found that P&amp;S camera were too limiting and that my smallest DSLR was too big. This camera was perfect. It has the options of a bigger SLR and the smaller size of a Large P&amp;S. It has a ton of shooting sizes and all the regular shooting modes. Most of the shooting options can be managed from the exterior dials without going in to the menu&apos;s.</Review>

     <Review>I have been carrying this camera everywhere. If your use to film camera&apos;s you will be right at home with this one. I love all of the easy to adjust dials and the user settings that make it fun to use. I did have to upgrade the firmware when I first got it but that is easy and on the Nikon web site. The camera is a little slow to turn on but once it is on the shutter is snappy. This will be the camera I bring with when I don&apos;t feel like carrying my SLR kit around.</Review>

     <Review>BH Sure it&apos;s smaller and easier to carry. But it isn&apos;t so small that it easily fits in your pocket. The results I&apos;ve gotten and the quality of the optics are wonderful. After all, it&apos;s a Nikon. And for that, I&apos;m satisfied. I use it for interior architectural shots and use a bounce flash which the hot-shoe accommodates well. I&apos;ll have to wait until the wide angle adapter is available to duplicate the shots I get with my Nikon SLR. Just like a cop with a back-up revolver, the P7000 is a trusted tool that can be depended upon.</Review>

     <Review>What is really interesting about this camera is that Nikon has thought through how you use a portable camera in the field. A lot of using a small camera like this is to be able to travel light and shoot fast. What I want is instant access to just the control I need. Nikon provides this opportunity with the ability to customize your own shooting setting for instant access. When you get don configuring all the custom settings you have defined your own personal work flow. It&apos;s really cool. When they said the CoolPix P 7000 has a low light shooting adjustment, hey there were not kidding. Hard to know what is just promotional hype these days so I kind of ignored it. But this is real. You really can shoot in available light far more often than I could with my old camera. Great feature.</Review>

     <Review>With my owning 2 SLR&apos;s (Canon and Nikon), my expectations of the Nikon P7000 were a quality point-and-shoot, although of lesser quality than my true SLR&apos;s. Surprisingly, image quality, manual control, flash and format (SD/SDHC etc.) compatibility are peceptibly equivalent to comparable focal length DSLRs that I own. Bit of a learning curve in mastering the Menu system, although much the same as that of my Nikon DSLR. Onboard flash superior to any other I&apos;ve come across! Problems cited by other reviewers appear to be corrected with Firmware (1.1) update, which I immediately applied. Complaints: None, except perhaps would be nice if HD video were 1080i/p and true AVCHD, rather than 720p MOV fomat.</Review>

     <Review>I purchased this with a P7100. The Bower tube adapter fit well and seemed to be of very good quality (metal). I gave this 4 stars if you intend to use it to protect the lens when it is extended. Adding filters to this will cause vignetting at wider angle settings. I would like to see the outer section flare out so that larger filters could be added, minimizing or reducing vignetting.</Review>

     <Review>This camera is a bulletproof little point and shoot that takes top-quality images. It&apos;s compact in size and the metal body make it the perfect camera for my rock climbing adventures. I&apos;m very happy with it.</Review>

     <Review>I was delighted when Nikon came out with a high end P&amp;S with a viewfinder. I was looking for a small lightweight camera to throw in my bag when I wasn&apos;t taking my larger cameras with me (I was missing too many shots that I would have loved to have gotten and other pro friends recommended a good P&amp;S to have with me at all times). I have been very disappointed. Outdoor scenic shots are OK but indoor shots are not. Focus is slow and irregular in what it chooses to focus on. Shutter is temperamental. I can be shooting in the same light, at the same distance, with the same settings and get entirely different shots in terms of focus, WB and exposure. This purchase was a mistake!</Review>

     <Review>Originally purchased to replace my Canon G10, I wanted higher ISO with less noise, which the Nikon and Canon G12 both deliver. On the Nikon P7000, I was disappointed in:1. Pop-up flash2. Four steps required to change ISO, as opposed to one on the Canon G123. Color balance/processing-just never quite right4. On-screen menu adjustments, as opposed to quick adjustments on the Canon, without scrolling through on-screen menus.[...]</Review>

     <Review>Pros: Good Image Quality; Good Image Stabilization; Great Zoom; Large Clear LCD; Easy To Use; Nice Body Color; Good in Low Light

OK, first of all, the combo is good for the price at the time I bought it (mid October). Overall, everything seems useful except for camera case, which fits the camera too tightly thus makes it difficult to insert/remove the camera in a flash.

This camera produces images with quality that rivals even the entry-level DSLRs such as the Nikon D40 (my first DSLR) in a much more portable package, and even more if you consider the available zoom range. The high ISO images are better than the Nikon D40 can achieve at ISO 800.

The camera body contains enough knobs for manual control of exposure, shooting mode, and various settings that make using i ... t a joy, but only if you are familiar with an DSLR camera before. For people wanting to get a good &amp; easy to use point-and-shoot camera, this is not it. But for previous DSLR owners, this is fantastic as a backup and/or travel camera. The build quality is typical of Nikon DSLR, not point and shoot cameras.

There are quite a few complaints on the net about the issues such as slow .NRW writing speed, lens focus error re-initialization, etc. My own experiences confirm these issues, but I belive their impacts largely depend on personal shooting preferences.

Overall, a fantastic supplemental camera for DSLR owners. The firmware could use some improvements. Top IQ &amp; ergonomic in its camera class.

     <Review>As a substitute to carrying a D-SLR this camera has just enough going for it. I wouldn&apos;t employ this as a back-up camera. However, with the ease this light weight and capable unit I&apos;ve gotten back to carrying a camera most everywhere I go. The lens is sharp enough with good contrast. It also sports a very useful range. And as long as light levels don&apos;t get too low it will rival it&apos;s larger and more capable brethren.</Review>

     <Review>Nice form factor, The viewfinder is a extra.. but not that useful It would be nice if they could include that at some point Manual setting is excellent aperture priority works fine shutter speed priority is.. kinda junk.. You can get super under/over exposed, and there isn&apos;t an under exp/over exp indicator in this mode (that i could find) there&apos;s just a blinking box that indicates wrong,try again : / The super tiny flash is rather impressive. It produces nice clean fills without the harsh effects you would think a flash will produce I like the quality of the photos, and the form factor of the camera. If you want something that takes sharp pictures and can deal with the loss of exposure priority, then its a really nice compact photo companion.. Manual,AP, and the various autos ar ... e available I recommend the software photo matrix as something to buy if you havent yet. NH

     <Review>My P6000 was stolen late this summer, and I was down in the dumps until I saw the new P7000 offered. Bought it immediately, and glad I did. It is a great little P&amp;S, and finally comparable to the G11/12. Added telephoto length is a plus. New and easier to use menu controls. I am a Nikon DSLR shooter, but need a small P&amp;S for scouting and traveling. Compatible with Nikon speedlites and remote, it is a great addition to the camera bag. And easy enough to hand off to someone else to shoot on their own.</Review>

     <Review>All the cameras i have had were a good ones: SLR`s asahi pentax spotmatic and nikon E70, both with many accesories. My first point and shot camera was coolpix 7900, also great. But using this one, I wear it in my trousers pocket, I can`t thing in buying other one (D7000 on my mind) for the moment. The only problems I have had were related with the ergonomy. Is very easy to change configuration when you are in a hurry due to some butons place.</Review>

     <Review>I needed a small camera to take hiking, my D70s is very bulky and it was a pain when I went hiking. This camera is great for that. The camera produces very nice images and the controls are very easy to handle. The main problem I have with this camera is that when I go hiking it is very bright and the monitor is useless and it is very hard to read the manual setting information and there is no information given through the viewfinder. Otherwise this is an excellent camera</Review>

     <Review>Pros: Easy To Use; Good Image Stabilization; Good Image Quality; Light weight; Great Build Quality; Large Clear LCD

When you don&apos;t want to carry your DSLR, this is the camera to take. Image quality was great even in the automatic mode, the 3 inch screen is clear and having an optical viewfinder is a plus. Feels better than the Canon G11 and G12. I&apos;m a D300 and D200 user and this is a great addition.</Review>

     <Review>The adapter tube fits the P7000 perfectly. It does partially obstruct the viewfinder. If you compose using the LCD, it works fine. If you add the tulip lens hood, the viewfinder is nearly totally obstructed. The LCD will be the only way to compose. The tube is metal and well built. It should protect the lens to some degree.</Review>

     <Review>The P7000 exceeded my expectations by a wide margin. Ease of use, semi-compactness and superb optics make it a real pleasure to use. There are so many creative settings that it is hard to decide which to use first.</Review>
