     <Review>The Canon PowerShot S95 is a compact digital camera that&apos;s perfect for travellers or even photography enthusiasts who want a small camera with manual controls. 

It&apos;s very small, yet it&apos;s designed to allow you to change the exposure almost as quickly as you could with a digital SLR. If you don&apos;t want to change the exposure settings manually, the Canon PowerShot S95 has an auto mode and plenty of scene modes to help you get the most out of it straight away.

The Canon PowerShot S95 is the type of compact camera you buy when you absolutely must have something that will be very easy to carry around, yet also be capable of capturing very good quality images at a moment&apos;s notice. We think it&apos;s perfect to take on holiday or on a work trip as it can be used effectively in all kinds of ... lighting situations.

Canon PowerShot S95: Specifications

It has a 10-megapixel CCD sensor, but at 1/1.7in, it&apos;s slightly bigger than the CCD sensor in a typical compact camera such as the Canon PowerShot SX210 IS, which has a 1/2.3in sensor. The Canon PowerShot S95 has the same sensor size as other advanced compact cameras such as Samsung&apos;s EX1, but it&apos;s a smidgin smaller than the 1/1.63in sensor that can be found in Panasonic&apos;s LUMIX DMC-LX3 and LX5. The slightly larger sensor allows more light to be captured, which means that overall the camera can produce more vibrant images than a typical compact.

Sitting in front of the sensor is a 28-105mm zoom lens with an aperture of f/2.0, which is nice and wide for capturing images in low-light situations. It closes to f/4.9 when you zoom in all the way, and the smallest size you can use is f/8.0. Its star-shaped diaphragm renders lights with a lovely star burst–like effect, which can look good when capturing reflections during the day and streetlights during the night, for example.

The lens&apos; diaphragm renders lights and reflections with a lovely star burst shape.

The Canon PowerShot S95 camera&apos;s shutter speed isn&apos;t overly quick; it only goes as fast as 1/1600th of a second, but it can slow down to 15sec for night shoots. We would have liked it to shut at least as fast as 1/2000th of a second, which is a speed that most compacts can achieve. Still, this isn&apos;t too much of an inconvenience and we had no problems using the S95 on very bright days. At the other end of the scale, we would have liked the shutter to be able to stay open for a least one minute for tasks such as capturing lightning or fireworks at night. (There is a fireworks scene mode, but it only keeps the shutter open for two seconds.)

Canon PowerShot S95: Picture quality

A night scene as captured using aperture priority mode with a aperture of f/2.0 and an ISO of 100.

Image quality is very good. Pictures are captured clearly and with accurate colour tones; when it&apos;s in auto and semi-auto modes, the camera does a good job of properly exposing each scene. Even difficult scenes featuring both highlights and dark shadows were captured accurately. The camera has a good handle on noise up to around ISO 400, but we&apos;d recommend using as low an ISO as possible, as pictures will start to look too grainy above that figure. With the wide aperture, a high ISO isn&apos;t always needed anyway.

Colours are rendered accurately and aren&apos;t overdone. This was taken in a shaded area.

Even at their full size, images retain their clarity and you can make out fine details.

The Canon PowerShot S95 is accurate and versatile when it comes to focusing, but it&apos;s only accurate if you want to focus on a subject in the central parts of the frame. You can use tracking mode to lock on to subjects and then bring them to the side of the frame if you want to give your photos are more interesting perspective. This worked very well in our tests and we&apos;re also pleased with the amount of background blur that occurs with a wide aperture of f/2.0.

We used tracking mode focus to bring Tux to the right side of the frame. The camera kept focus even as we moved closer to him.

     <Review>Pros: Very good photo quality, with a full stop advantage over typical compact cameras at high sensitivities; Fast F2.0-4.9, 28 - 105 mm zoom lens; New and improved &quot;hybrid&quot; optical image stabilization; High resolution 3-inch LCD with outstanding outdoor and low light visibility; Fast start-up time; Full manual controls, including RAW support; Smart Auto mode picks one of 28 scene modes for you;
Handy HDR, shadow, and dynamic range correction feature; Lots of customizable stuff: control ring and shortcut button, self-timer, My Menu, custom spot on mode dial; Cool face, smile, and wink self-timers; Records 720p24 video with stereo sound; Optional underwater case; HDMI output

Cons: Redeye a problem -- some highlight clipping; Videos are a bit choppy due to 24 fps frame rate -- opti ... cal zoom cannot be used while recording a movie; Ergonomic annoyances: ring function / power buttons easy to confuse, small zoom controller / shutter release button, flash takes up finger space when raised; Below average battery life; No optical viewfinder; Full manual on CD-ROM;
No memory card included -- can&apos;t access memory card slot while using a tripod

The Canon PowerShot S90 was already an impressive camera, and the S95 is a nice upgrade that adds some useful new features. The basics haven&apos;t changed; the S95 has the same 10 Megapixel, high sensitivity CCD, fast 3.8X optical zoom lens, and customizable controls of its predecessor. New features include an improved image stabilization system, useful HDR and shadow/highlight correction options, and a 720p movie mode. The S95 also retains many of the annoyances of the PowerShot S90, which include so-so ergonomic and below average battery life. Even with a few flaws, the S95 is a great choice for those who want a capable low light camera that can go anywhere you do.

Fresh off reviewing the Panasonic LX5, I&apos;m impressed by the similarities between it and the Canon PowerShot S95. Both have a 3.8x, f/2.0, image-stabilized lens, a 3-inch LCD, a 10-megapixel sensor, a pop-up flash, a zoom toggle surrounding the shutter button, and more dials than the average pocket digital camera. Of course, there are differences as well. The Canon S95&apos;s focal length ranges from 28-105mm, while the LX5&apos;s covers a wider 24-90mm. The S95&apos;s LCD is a 4:3 aspect ratio, while the LX5&apos;s is 3:2. The Canon S95 is also smaller and has no hot shoe, while it does have a unique reprogrammable front Control Ring. They are both aimed at the premium pocket market, and also differ only slightly from their predecessors. For its part, the Canon S95 is improved in some important ways.
*Look and feel*. Canon did a great job making the S95 compact, yet with a bright lens and larger sensor than the average digital camera. Dressed all in black, the boldest element of the Canon S95 is the bright white Canon logo, embossed just as it is on the company&apos;s digital SLRs. Everything else appears military-grade, designed for stealth, perfect for street photography. Even the S95 logo the font around the lens barrel are a dark gray, unlike the S90&apos;s bright white. Other than that, little has changed on the front of the S95, except that the microphone hole has been replaced with microphone holes at the lower left and right of the lens to accommodate the Canon S95&apos;s stereo audio recording with the new 720p HD movie mode.
The Canon S95&apos;s lens flange does protrude more than the company&apos;s other pocket cameras, but that&apos;s understandable, and in this case, useful. The knurled ring surrounding the lens is the multi-purpose Control Ring, which you can reprogram by pressing the Ring Function button next to the Power button. These two buttons, incidentally, are now put in their right positions, with the power button beside the shutter button, where we&apos;ve been trained to expect it. With the S90, I very often hit the Ring Function button when I&apos;d intended to power off the camera.
The Canon S95 has no grip, but the texture of the camera is a little rougher to improve the grip. It&apos;s not a significant improvement, though, so if it&apos;s difficult for you to hold, consider an aftermarket stick-on grip. More on this, and how it affects the overall use of the camera, later.
In the upper left corner of the top, you see the cutout for the flash. Unlike the LX5, the Canon S95&apos;s flash comes up under motorized power, and is deployed when the camera decides to, either because the light is too...

     <Review>Although the S95 is only a small improvement over the already excellent S90, the combination of small improvements do add up to a significantly better camera. Overall performance could still use some improvement, but creative versatility and more importantly image quality, especially in low light, are as good as it currently gets. TrustedReviews Awards logo Best Advanced Compact Digital Camera In nature it is competition that drives the process of evolution. As species compete for limited resources they evolve over time to become better adapted to the needs of their environment. The same evolutionary process operates in the world of digital cameras. Manufacturers compete for the resource of your spending money, and the evolutionary result is ever more sophisticated cameras, with better per ... formance, better image quality and more advanced features. There are few better examples of this than the long-running rivalry between Canon and Panasonic in the specialised environment of advanced enthusiast&apos;s compact cameras. Canon PowerShot S95 front angle Last year saw the re-launch of Canon&apos;s advanced PowerShot S-series in the shape of the S90, an advanced compact featuring the same 10-megapixel sensor as Canon&apos;s flagship at the time, the PowerShot G11. The S90 was Canon&apos;s response to the success of Panasonic&apos;s superb Lumix LX3, itself a successor to 2006&apos;s LX1, which had been introduced to compete with the S90&apos;s predecessor, Canon&apos;s PowerShot S80, launched in 2005. These competitions can get complicated. Panasonic has recently launched the latest in the LX line, the excellent Lumix LX5, so it will come as little surprise that Canon has also launched its latest competitor, the PowerShot S95. Like Panasonic, Canon has only made small changes and upgrades to the S90 to produce the new camera, but the cumulative effect is a significant improvement over the older model. Canon PowerShot S95 front Although the S95 and the LX5 look very different they are actually very similar cameras in many respects. Both have 10-megapixel sensors of a larger size than those found in most current compacts (1/1.7-in for the S95 and 1/1.63-in for the LX5). Both have high-quality 3.8x zoom lenses with fast f/2 maximum aperture, both have 7.5cm (3.0-in) LCD monitors with 460k resolution. Both offer a full range of manual exposure options, both shoot 720p HD video (although the S95 does so with stereo audio) and both have pop-up flash units. Even more importantly both cameras are currently have a high street price of £399.

     <Review>The Canon Powershot S95 was released a little over a year after its predecessor, the Canon S90, was announced. 

Building on a legacy of quality premium compact cameras, and with more and more entering the market, Canon have a lot to compete with nowadays, so does the Canon S95 still hold muster?

Update: See our video review below

Improvements on the Canon S95 include the addition of the HS system, a combination of a high-sensitivity 10.0 megapixel CCD sensor and DIGIC 4 processor, promising optimised low-light shooting. Manual control has also been upgraded, while HD movie recording has been added. 

For the first time in a compact, Canon&apos;s Hybrid IS technology which provides image stabilisation has also been incorporated. It&apos;s brought over the ability to shoot i ... n RAW, the useful ring-control system and the same 6-22.5mm (35mm equivalent: 28-105mm) f/2.0 lens. In short, you&apos;re getting a fair old bang for your buck.

Bearing in mind that physically the Canon S95 is more or less the same as the PowerShot S90 (it&apos;s a touch smaller than the S90 and now uses the same coating as found on the Canon 7D semi-pro DSLR in a bid to improve grip), first impressions of the camera are good. 

The sleek body and metal finish lend it air of class, while its miniature size belies its impressive stats. The little brother of the Canon G12, this is probably one of the only high-end compacts on the market that is truly pocketable. As well as adding to the sleek design, it&apos;s nice not to have a fiddly lenscap to keep track of such as on the likes of the Panasonic LX5.

     <Review>Pros: Manual controls, very good images in all light levels, shoots 720p HD video, big, sharp LCD display

Cons: Slow camera speed, short battery life, optical zoom doesn&apos;t work with video

The Canon PowerShot S95 may be pocket-sized, but testers say this businesslike black camera offers the manual controls -- and high-quality images -- of a larger, pricier, more advanced camera. For about $100 less than the more advanced Canon PowerShot G12 , you&apos;ll get the very same 10-megapixel sensor, and reviewers say these cameras capture better night and indoor shots than most compact cameras. ...</Review>

     <Review>I work all day in front of a computer so when I pick up a camera, I typically like to shoot film. It&apos;s a break from my work day but also I adore the aesthetic quality of film. I have a Hasselblad 500c and Leica R4. In the past have tinkered with digital point and shoots but I have bad luck with them breaking and what not. So I decided to finally invest in another digital camera and portable case (Lowepro D-Wrap). Here&apos;s some of the things I immediately liked about this camera... -Compact: Beats lugging around the Hasselblad and it&apos;s pocket size makes it great to take to any event. -RAW Format: This is one of the major perks my co-workers highlighted when I ask their opinion on digital point and shoots (I work at a photo center). -Manual focusing option: I was surprised when I discovere ... d this, but pleasantly so. -Overall Image Quality: So far I have been pretty impressed with this little guy. Shooting in both Manual and Auto modes, I am happy with color management on this camera. I have yet to print any of the image so I might have a follow up report when I do. Things that I wish were different... Flash Placement: If you hold this camera like most people hold small digital cameras you will most likely end up placing your left hand index finger directly over the on retractable on camera flash. This is annoying when flash is in auto mode and you end up smashing it with your hand. No View Finder: In the past I will by pass the rear LCD when my battery is low and use the good old fashion view finder. Alas this camera does not have one. My last digital camera got in a fight with my Hasselblad in my camera bag which resulted in a smashed LCD. It too had no view finder so I haphazardly shot with no idea of what I was capturing. A little Slow: The cycle time between shots feels a little slow. Lack of contour to Body: This is just my general paranoia kicking in, but I have a history of being clumsy. I worry since this camera is so strealine (even the buttons manage to be almost flush to the body) that I will drop it easily. I readied this with the Lowepro D-Wrap which remains attached to the camera body even while shooting adding an additional area to hold on to. We shall see. I have only had this camera a little while and I am interested to see how my relationship unfolds.

     <Review>I doubt this camera will be available for too much longer as the new models come out, so if you&apos;re in the market for a good quality pocket camera, add this one to your arsenal. I would go as far as to say this is a MUST HAVE for any serious point and shooter, especially if you&apos;re a Canon fan. I just bought my second one this week from B&amp;H, just to have a back-up in case I lose my other one. Good price now too. A few main things I like about the camera that are most important to me: It has fast, accurate autofocus (at all distances) down to macro. It doesn&apos;t get fooled too often. Superb, SLR quality manual control, Excellent lens, it&apos;s great having F/2 for low light. F/4 is the lens&apos; sweet spot, best resolution. F/5.6 is good for best overall IQ with moderate depth of field. F/8 has ... really crisp DOF out to 2 feet, and maybe a little beyond. It&apos;s a good indoor camera for documenting hobby projects and close-up work. It&apos;s obviously a great outdoor camera too, does macro flowers well, but don&apos;t count on the big F/2 aperture to deliver the bokeh you get with an SLR. It&apos;s still a small sensor camera. The zoom is modest, but it&apos;s really sharp at mid range to max telephoto, even edge to edge. At wide angle resolution is awesome for a small camera, but sharpness falls off a tiny bit in the far corners, as do most small wide angles. No complaints about this lens. It has a really beautiful, sharp LCD screen too, almost too pretty. It has a slightly larger sensor than an average compact???1/1.7 with an appropriate 10 MP that delivers excellent color and image quality. And again, 10 Mega Pixels with a compact camera is perfect. (Less is more???too true) It&apos;s a really well made camera and just feels solid, almost heavy. The menu is a typical Canon layout, very intuitive. (I think Canon, and Nikon, have the best menus in the business) The S95&apos;s controls feel really high quality and precise. It&apos;s like a small fine tool???one of Canon&apos;s finest products. Main Gripe: It&apos;s harder on batteries than my other Canon cameras (like my SD980), using the same NB-6L Li-ion. People are probably tired of hearing me say this, but if the S95 used AA batteries (Ultimate Lithiums) it would be the perfect camera. And AA&apos;s would be a good reason for Canon to give it a bulging grip to house those batteries. COOL!!! There are personal reasons why I decided to go ahead and buy another S95 instead of waiting for its S100 replacement. Mostly, I just like the controls on the S95 better. And it&apos;s 10MP too. The S100 will have the new DIGIC 5 processor though. So we&apos;ll see???

     <Review>I wanted a small camera that would shoot RAW when it&apos;s not practical to carry my DSLR. This is it. Pocket-sized and 10 MP with RAW format available. Though the sensor is certainly smaller than 4/3 or APS-C, it is still a bit larger than the typical pocket-sized point-and-shoot cameras. I&apos;ve only had it for a couple weeks but have found the images to be sharp and the colors to be rich. It&apos;s too early to evaluate battery life. Since I&apos;m not a video guy I can&apos;t comment on that either. There are many settings on this camera so if you&apos;re looking for control this could be what you want. If you&apos;re just looking for simple point-and-shoot, this is definitely much more than you will ever need so save the money and get something cheaper.</Review>

     <Review>I picked this camera up on a great 2011 Christmas special. I have been happy using an Canon 870IS for several years, and more recently a Canon 300HS. I was pretty excited to finally get a P&amp;S that shoots RAW. However, not all modes support RAW capture which was a HUGE disappointment. The primary reason for RAW for me was to get around the horrible smaller sensor in camera JPG rendering. I work in the professional printing industry and my primary camera is a Nikon D300S with mostly prime lenses. While ISO performance as very good. Overall image quality was not significantly better than the 300HS under most indoor shooting conditions. Which is the main use for a point and shoot IMO. Canon now requires five button presses to delete an image. I often like to delete photos in came ... ra so that I don&apos;t have to transfer or sort them later. (Nikon&apos;s let you chose between two quick presses or 4.) Much better video than Nikon or Olympus competitors. The size is great, and ergonomics wasn&apos;t as nice as the 300HS IMO. Even if you get a great deal on this camera Canon&apos;s models selling for half the price will serve most people&apos;s needs better. I&apos;ve researched every camera in this range and there is always a tradeoff. When you get into the five hundred dollar price range you might as well get an entry level DSLR.

     <Review>Let&apos;s just assume this camera takes good pictures for what it is and that the price is good given it&apos;s size/portability vs. the competition. I think some of the features in the software are dumb. I also like to shoot B&amp;W and think I should be able to turn it on no matter what mode I&apos;m in but the camera doesn&apos;t seem to do that, or, I just can&apos;t figure it out. User manual on CD is lame; please provide a printed book. Personally I think the battery life is pretty decent. I bought the Pearstone spare and the charging time is quite good for both batteries. Mainly it&apos;s just the limited, or possibly difficult to access, B&amp;W which really frustrates me about this camera. I think B&amp;W should be a default button or super easy to access in any mode at any time. Otherwise I like it. LCD ... is quite good.

     <Review>They&apos;ve really done it right with this camera. I justified buying this camera because I have a background in photography, although it&apos;s been a while since I&apos;ve had decent still photography equipment. I told my wife that it would pay for itself if I could take my new daughter&apos;s yearly portraits with it. I knew I would be using a slave flash. With a lot of trial and error, I was able to get some usable photos. I wish they had a way to trigger a flash without using the on-board flash. It&apos;s a great size for all the features. At first, I thought the control ring around the lens was too bulky, and thought it stuck out of the camera too much. Of course that is the idea. It only took me a couple of days to get used to it and compared to a larger DSLR, it&apos;s wonderful. I also missed the viewfinde ... r at first. I&apos;m kinda used to them, but the screen is so nice, that it&apos;s easy to live without it. While the mode wheel seems very high quality, it is a little stiff to turn. I&apos;ll take it over a cheap-feeling knob. I only wish it had a GPS chip for geolocation metadata... I might have paid an extra $50-75 for that. I wish it had a different color tally light for taking video. This goes for any camera. That way people aren&apos;t constantly wondering if you&apos;re taking a picture or video footage.

     <Review>Appearance/Size/Form FactorCompared to other cameras in the advanced compact category, the S95 is tiny. The S95 can easily slip into your pants pocket without anyone asking you is that a camera in your pocket or are you just happy to see me?. If a compact camera body is one of your major requirements, the S95 should be at the top of your list.One plus the S95 has over its predecessor (the S90) is its textureized body. The S90 felt like a wet bar of soap which is not a characteristic I look for in a camera. This rubbery/grippy texture allows the user to gain a sold grip on the camera which is important when dealing with a camera this small. The S95 feels good in your hand although I do wish it had more of a physical grip similar to the Panasonic LX-5; I assume Canon decided against a grip t ... o keep the body as slim and sleek as possible. I&apos;m not too worried about the lack of grip as there are a few third party options to remedy this complaint e.g. Richard Franiec&apos;s custom grip.I&apos;m not sure what people consider a good looking camera, but the S95 looks good to me. The all black body with silver lettering is a color scheme that should be familiar to most. The display takes up the majority of the real-estate on the back of the camera which is a good thing because it is a pleasure to use. Colors are bright and blacks look decent as well. My only complaint with the display, which is common among most point and shoot cameras, is it easily becomes washed out in bright sunlight. This is when I really wish Canon had offered an optional EVF for the S95.ControlsEasy access to controls is where the S95 really jumps ahead of the competition. I hate digging through levels of menus or having to cycle down a list of features just to change the ISO. Give me physical buttons! Luckily there are two dials on the S95, one in the front and one in the back of the camera. These dials allow the user to easily change the most frequently needed settings.Like it&apos;s older sibling, the S95 has a control ring around the lens which gives you quick access to settings like aperture, shutter speed, focal length, etc. The control ring has default settings based on which mode you are in but the control ring&apos;s function can easily be changed by a physical button on the top of the camera.On the back of the back of the camera is another function ring. By default, this ring is setup to manage the functions which are available by pushing on the top, bottom, left and right or the ring. I would say 99% of the time I use this ring to manage exposure compensation. The other 1% of the time it is used to manage shutter speed while I&apos;m in Manual mode???I prefer to shoot in Aperture Priority when using the S95.Along with the dials is a programmable button on the back of the camera which can be assigned by the user; I have mine set to pull up the ISO. This can be set to a myriad of different functions like white balance or file type, but I find that setting this to ISO really gives me quick access to the essentials for getting a solid exposure.FeaturesLike any new camera, there are a million features that the S95 brings to the game. I could list them all here, but you would probably have better luck looking at a product page. To keep it short, I&apos;ll list a few of my favorite features of this camera:ISO max for auto ISO: Most new advanced point and shoot cameras have an auto ISO setting. The problem with this is not all of them give you a limit as to how high the camera will go when choosing an ISO setting. Thankfully, the S95 does. I personally like to set my ISO manually, but this is a nice feature if you are a beginner or if you just want to shoot and not worry about settings.Interval timer with shot # selection: This is something I wish my old 5D had. Not only can you select the shutter timer duration, you can also select how many shots in succession the S95 will take after the timer goes off. I could see this feature being helpful for family portraits or landscapes.Bright Lens: With a bright f/2.0 lens and IS, the S95 works surprisingly well in low-light conditions....

     <Review>Pros: Small / Compact; Good Image Stabilization; Good in Low Light; Fast/accurate auto-focus; Good Image Quality; Large Clear LCD; Easy To Use

Cons: No Viewfinder; Max aperture when zoomed; Limited Zoom

Appearance/Size/Form FactorCompared to other cameras in the &quot;advanced compact&quot; category, the S95 is tiny. The S95 can easily slip into your pants pocket without anyone asking you &quot;is that a camera in your pocket or are you just happy to see me?&quot;. If a compact camera body is one of your major requirements, the S95 should be at the top of your list.One plus the S95 has over its predecessor (the S90) is its textureized body. The S90 felt like a wet bar of soap which is not a characteristic I look for in a camera. This rubbery/grippy texture allows the user to gain a sold grip on ... the camera which is important when dealing with a camera this small. The S95 feels good in your hand although I do wish it had more of a physical grip similar to the Panasonic LX-5; I assume Canon decided against a grip to keep the body as slim and sleek as possible. I&apos;m not too worried about the lack of grip as there are a few third party options to remedy this complaint e.g. Richard Franiec&apos;s custom grip.I&apos;m not sure what people consider a good looking camera, but the S95 looks good to me. The all black body with silver lettering is a color scheme that should be familiar to most. The display takes up the majority of the real-estate on the back of the camera which is a good thing because it is a pleasure to use. Colors are bright and blacks look decent as well. My only complaint with the display, which is common among most point and shoot cameras, is it easily becomes washed out in bright sunlight. This is when I really wish Canon had offered an optional EVF for the S95.ControlsEasy access to controls is where the S95 really jumps ahead of the competition. I hate digging through levels of menus or having to cycle down a list of features just to change the ISO. Give me physical buttons! Luckily there are two dials on the S95, one in the front and one in the back of the camera. These dials allow the user to easily change the most frequently needed settings.Like it&apos;s older sibling, the S95 has a control ring around the lens which gives you quick access to settings like aperture, shutter speed, focal length, etc. The control ring has default settings based on which mode you are in but the control ring&apos;s function can easily be changed by a physical button on the top of the camera.On the back of the back of the camera is another function ring. By default, this ring is setup to manage the functions which are available by pushing on the top, bottom, left and right or the ring. I would say 99% of the time I use this ring to manage exposure compensation. The other 1% of the time it is used to manage shutter speed while I&apos;m in Manual mode…I prefer to shoot in Aperture Priority when using the S95.Along with the dials is a programmable button on the back of the camera which can be assigned by the user; I have mine set to pull up the ISO. This can be set to a myriad of different functions like white balance or file type, but I find that setting this to ISO really gives me quick access to the essentials for getting a solid exposure.FeaturesLike any new camera, there are a million features that the S95 brings to the game. I could list them all here, but you would probably have better luck looking at a product page. To keep it short, I&apos;ll list a few of my favorite features of this camera:ISO max for auto ISO: Most new advanced point and shoot cameras have an auto ISO setting. The problem with this is not all of them give you a limit as to how high the camera will go when choosing an ISO setting. Thankfully, the S95 does. I personally like to set my ISO manually, but this is a nice feature if you are a beginner or if you just want to shoot and not worry about settings.Interval timer with shot # selection: This is something I wish my old 5D had. Not only can you select the shutter timer duration, you can also select how many shots in succession the S95...

     <Review>Pros: Great pictures, easy to use, great features

Cons: No viewfinder

This camera is incredible. I bought it after playing around with one that a coworker had bought for us to use here, and I can&apos;t say how impressed I am with it after owning it for about a month. My time to learn how to use it was during a wedding in India. The pictures turned out to be absolutely gorgeous, and I took over 500 pictures and videos of the event.

First, the picture quality is great. It&apos;s a great camera and has taken some super cool shots. The lens is really nice, and the ability to do fine-tune adjustment of the focus using the wheel on the front is really cool. The wheel on the back can also be used to tweak an image, and the combination of the two is fantastic. We blew up one of the pic ... tures of the Taj Mahal that we took on the highest resolution and it looks like a professional photograph. I&apos;m supremely confident that should we print up a painting size for this that it will look awesome.

The features on this camera are phenomenal. I took pictures using the &quot;Antique&quot; mode, and it looked like we were at the Taj Mahal in the 1920&apos;s. Using the &quot;Color Accent&quot; option, I got some really incredible shots of some of the festivities - highlighting just the red in the Henna ceremony, or selecting one color of the numerous Saaris. &quot;Vivid&quot; was hardly needed as the colors popped on their own, and admittedly this looked a little too over-saturated. The &quot;Miniaturize&quot; feature is also very cool, and takes some really neat artsy shots by blurring the top and bottom edge of the photo. All of these features have things that you can tweak using the ring on the front or the wheel on the back. The low-light setting was also great for night-time shots where you don&apos;t want the flash to go off every 3 seconds.

The camera is extremely easy to use. It has a setting for full auto and makes it a point and shoot. The camera comes up and is ready to take a picture extremely fast, and the continuous shooting is also very easy to set up. All in all, I spent about 30 minutes (which i ...

     <Review>Bought this camera for both the photo and video features. As filmmakers, my husband and I like to have something small in our pockets at all times to sketch out ideas, scout locations, and create short films. Though only 720p, the image quality on the videos is absolutely outstanding. The lag (in video modes) on the autofocus and autoexposure is very tolerable. I can already say we&apos;ll use this more than our flip cam because the image quality is superior. The miniature feature is also a fun effect that I would actually use (not a common thing in regard to built-in effects). The photos are comparably sharp and the colors rich, even in low light. I&apos;m a big fan of slightly saturated color though, so if you want something 100% natural, you may need to do some correcting later. The body ... design and the ring for changing settings on the front gives this camera a fantastic feel! If you&apos;re used to an SLR like me, you&apos;ll feel at home with this little guy. Haven&apos;t really paid much attention to the audio. I carry a little Tascam digital recorder around for that, so it didn&apos;t play into my decision to buy. The only con: The placement of the power button makes it really easy to press on accident. Overall it&apos;s the perfect pocket camera for creative professionals who like to be prepared for great quality images &amp; videos on the fly.

     <Review>Pros: Fast lense, great high ISO performance, IS

Cons: No ACR support (RAW), turn-on time is somewhat slow, flash control

I am not sure if I will own this camera (S95) after the 14-day return period. This is due to my G9 failing due to a major design/manufacturing flaw and Canon refusing to accept responsibility. Google &quot;G9 loose screw&quot;. The G-series cameras self destruct. You end up with a $500 paperweight. Canon refuses to acknowledge any issue AT ALL. There are hundreds, if not thousands, of cases posted on the internet. I am pretty disgusted with Canon at this point, since my Canon DSLR investment is well into the five figures. No 5D Mark II at this point to use with my 20D and 40D. All future equipment purchases are on hold.

The S95 is a sweet camera that I purcha ... sed to replace/compliment both my SD550 and G9. I have created about 30 DVDs worth of video from the two cameras of my five year old daughter. Between videos and photos, I will not go without a carry everywhere camera. A cell phone does not work as an acceptable substitute.

I bought the S95 (instead of S90 earlier) mainly due to the addition of 720 video. The f/2.0 lense is sweet, and having IS finally on my small P&amp;S (not on my SD550) is great too. I have done handheld shots at 1/5 on the G9 with great results.

The controls in manual work very well. The ring around the lense does aperture, the main control dial does shutter speed and then I programmed the print button to do ISO. One reason I will never buy a Canon Rebel DSLR is due to the lack of two control dials in manual. The little P&amp;S has two!

Two issues I have right now concern my video and photo PP workflow. Canon does NOT support the S95 in ACR. The DPP software just flatout sucks. Also, my normal video editing/burning methods are not supported with 720, so that will require a software upgrade. I normally shoot RAW + small jpg with the jpg used only for TV or quick reference viewing. I have started shooting the S95 in RAW + full jpg, with the RAWs getting archived for later work. I edit the jpgs in ACR (CS3). Works great, but the control of shadows and highli ...

     <Review>This is the best pocket camera I&apos;ve owned - and I have owned many. It is not a simple point and shoot camera, although it can be used as such. Picture quality is just about on par with my Nikon D300, and the camera&apos;s RAW format makes it possible for you to maximize all of your post-processing routines and procedures. It&apos;s versatility lies in its ability to adjust all of the settings a true photo enthusiast is normally concerned about, such as exposure compensation, ISO, aperture, shutter speed and optical zoom. The LCD screen produces images that are, bright, crisp and clear, even in the bright light of mid day. I have yet to encountered difficulty seeing the image on the screen - and I have not had to adjust the screen brightness setting to maximum. In spite of its excellent LCD scr ... een, I wish it had an optical view finder - but only because i am used to composing shots that way. But truth be told, using the LCD screen has some advantages over an optical finder. The biggest drawback is in the camera&apos;s long shutter delay. Anyone used to a fast shutter on a DSLR - especially for taking action shots or trying to capture those special fleeting expressions on the face of children - will sorely miss the instantaneous response of an SLR. So while I love the PowerShot S95, it will never replace my Nikon D300 or D700. The other minor drawback is a mediocre battery life. A spare battery is a must for anyone who is used to taking multiple images of the same, or nearly the same, object or scene. If you refrain from using the video feature, battery life is OK - but still not great. But the video is a nice feature, so why would you want to avoid using it because of concern about the battery life? Over all, this is an excellent pocket camera. I tend to take it everywhere. And for those who are wondering how it compares to the new camera in iPhone 4, the PowerShot S95 is far superior.

     <Review>My wife and I have been using this camera for about a month now. We got it to replace a Canon Digital Elph, and (though the jump in price makes it obvious) it truly is a totally different category of camera. Colors are crisp and true; the images are sharp. Pictures are surprisingly good under low light too (not excellent, but good--this is a point and shoot, after all). Other features we like are the control rings around the zoom lens and around the control button on the back. The former offers more fine-tune control of zooming. The camera also offers HDR for pics under non-ideal lighting (e.g. sunset). HD video recording is also very nice. The only minor complaints we have about this camera are the standard ones: it is easy to place your finger over the pop-up flash, and it is not the ... fastest camera between pics. But my understanding is that for true rapid shooting, you really need to step up to a more expensive DSLR or similar camera. Oh--the battery life. It really is short. You&apos;ll definitely want to get a second back-up battery. You won&apos;t make it through a day of shooting without one. It would be nice if it had GPS, but it doesn&apos;t. But those complaints are relatively minor. If you want a powerful camera that takes great pictures and the form factor of a point-and-shoot that you can put in your shirt-pocket, Canon&apos;s S95 is a great choice. Highly recommended.

     <Review>SUPERB! more portable and affordable than competitors: (GF-1, LX5, G11 etc.) Very crisp images. Good low-light settings. Nice control with front and rear wheels, customizable settings. Easy to use for novice, and great advanced features. Battery life has been impressive, full day of shooting stills and video is no problem. Good macro focus. Clear and sharp, faithful JPG color rendering, best I&apos;ve seen in a camera this size. Only gripes so far is 1. Digital zoom works while video is being recorded, but optical zoom and focus is locked on the setting that it started on. Full optical zoom can be utilized for video, but has to be set at beginning of recording. focus can&apos;t be changed while recording. 2. Has a hard time focusing unless an object is available to focus on (ie focus must f ... irst be set on a cloud in the sky, or horizon. Perhaps this can be changed with another focus setting. Very impressed with the first 500 images. Only a week old, but I&apos;m very happy with the cell-phoneesque size and ease of use, can hand it to any amateur and they will find it easy to use. Great quality for a camera of its size. Solid construction. I will probably buy one of the underwater housings for it. You should BUY IT! see for yourself: [@]

     <Review>I own a Canon Rebel xti, which is not too heavy to travel with but, I don&apos;t have money for an SLR waterproof case ($1000 is too much for a student!). I&apos;ve been watching for a good P&amp;S with a not expensive compatible case and S90 was my top choice. However, I was hesitating because of the lack of HD video and I waited until the upgraded version s95 (yay!) appeared. The s95 and WP-DC38 did a great job in my first ocean dive trip. HD video is not perfect but I guess you&apos;re not supposed to expect something crystal clear from a small camera like this. Overall exceeded my expectation! About the camera itself, there are plenty of reviews online so I&apos;m not going to say much. It does the job as described. Low light is very good, the color balance is always a little bit off compared with my xti ... . Love the ring function, much better than pushing lots of buttons... I&apos;m still not used all the functions and there&apos;s still lots of potentials to increase image qualities by knowing the tricks of camera settings. By the way, a fully charged battery survived 3 dives (about 40min/dive), about 120 pictures and 15min HD video. With a spare battery should be enough.

     <Review>Pros: Small, fast, great in low light, really smart camera

Cons: Needs an aftermarket grip to make it one-hand shootable.

This is an amazing camera and I&apos;m very happy. I put a small grip on it to make it more like the G12 and it&apos;s in my pocket every day now as I move around on my daily jaunts.

I take it to parties and use it at street fairs. Kids and grownups, it&apos;s in my pocket and I use it. I take it with me every day I leave the house.

I started with a G12. I saw an artist that had huge blow ups from the G10. He recommended the new G12 to me. The I got the G12 but it was heavy and bulkier than I really wanted to carry. I&apos;ve had big cameras; the sit at home. So I love the portability of this camera. The pictures are almost identical to the G12 and so is the sho ... oting experience. There are only a few times I miss the G12; when I have a crowd in front of me and I need the articulating view finder for example; that that is rare. It really doesn&apos;t come up that often.

I find as I get to know the S95, it fits my needs, I can compensate for it&apos;s lack of features in leiu of carrying it with me at all times. This day and age, we all have a civic duty to capture current events and I&apos;m ready at all times. I also love to take pictures of people, and plants and animals that come my way. And the shots of my kids have really improved.

I have set mine up to be silent, to take multiple pictures as I hold down the shutter button and to not show me pictures at all as they are taken. This really speeds up how fast the camera can resume and take the next shot and nobody even knows I&apos;m shooting; I just hold down the button with the camera on, as I hold it against my body, not even framing and I get great shots as I walk or stop to take in the scene. Very artistic and timely, I like shots that would usually never accept being photographed or framed with any delay at all.

As far as memory, don&apos;t spend a lot of money on a fast memory cart. Any level 10 card will do, this camera is not that fast to need a supper fast hi-end memory card.

     <Review>Pros: Fast/accurate auto-focus, Good Image Quality, Large Clear LCD, Small / Compact ... Cons: Poor placement of flash, Short Battery Life I bought this camera for vacation pictures with my family. I am a professional videographer and photographer and was tired of dragging my heavy professional stuff with me on family trips. As a result I missed many shots. This camera you can tuck in your pocket but still has many features that I like. It can be completely automatic or you can override all the features and make it manual. I can hand this camera to my wife who has no professional photography experience and get some nice shots. It is capable of shooting in RAW which really adds to the clarity and ones ability to crop/color correct, etc without a loss in quality. It does mean the files get l ... arge. So buy a big card, its worth it. It has the ability to be completely manual. Which I like since we all know sometimes automatic settings don&apos; always yield the best results. I can even do predictable flash daylight fill shots. I was surprised at the quality of the video too. I mean really surprised. It shoots in 1280x720 or 640x480 format which looks incredible. So now I do not have to pack the video camera either. It does have a few faults. The flash is placed in such a spot that while holding the camera, it tends to keep the flash from popping up when needed. The zoom is also very limited in it&apos;s range. However, it is perfect focal length overall though for family candids. Be sure to keep the battery charged at the end of the day. It can burn through power pretty fast. I bought a second battery just to be safe. Overall I am very pleased with this camera. No point and shoot camera can do it all but this one comes very close. Hope this review helps you in making the right choice!

     <Review>Pros:
Has all the features of a SLR camera.
Portable - Perfect to fit in my jeans pocket.
Sturdy - Metal frame. Perfect weight. Feels good.
Great screen size, with GREAT colors and definition. Pics look awesome on the screen.
Quick On and Off for quick moments.
Shock resistant

Cons:
Pictures do not look the same once you download them to your PC. Use a software to add more color/contrast and that&apos;s it!
Flash pops-up exactly where you have your finger to hold the camera.
Can&apos;t control flash (On-Off) in &quot;auto&quot; mode.

Over all it is an EXCELLENT camera. We love it!</Review>

     <Review>Just got this camera a week ago so I don&apos;t know everything about it yet. But the color is better than the Canon Powershot S45 or the A720 IS. The display is beautiful and bright, and despite the camera having lots of features, the controls are easy to use and well organized. Smile mode and wink mode - two goofy features I did not even know about and may rarely use - make everyone laugh. So maybe I will use them after all. Problems: I keep accidentally changing the exposure level by inadvertently twirling the control wheel in the back. A little attention to the display allows me to notice and correct that, and I think I should be attending to the exposure anyway. Another troublesome thing for me is that this camera is SMALL, a little heavy for its size and it doesn&apos;t have any grips ... to hang on to. However, the surface finish is textured and I haven&apos;t dropped it while shooting so I guess it&apos;s okay. Be sure to use the wrist strap! I have an older Canon Powershot A720 IS that is a dog and refuses to accept any batteries. Nothing is good enough for it. I hope this new PS95 - which uses NB-6L batteries - will presumably get along with its batteries like my PS S45 does. After one week I can&apos;t say. The pictures are great! And I like having quick access to the ISO settings! And it easily makes HDR images! This camera does exactly what I want - it gives me control over my images, but it fits in my pocket so I can carry it anywhere. Yay!

     <Review>Canon&apos;s S95 is a great digital camera (own 2 old Canons S500 &amp; G6). S95 has wonderful optics, sharp focus, superb colors and easy to navigate buttons/menus. Shooting in Program with Raw &amp; Jpeg formats, using a Lexar Pro 16 gb card. Hand-held close up, macro and low light shots are excellent, even better w tripod. Perfect size to carry in purse. Battery power could be better, however I carry an extra battery, no big deal. Very, very happy with purchase from wonderful B &amp; H Photo NYC.

     <Review>Pros: Literally everything is flawless.

Cons: It looks expensive, so I&apos;m afraid of it getting stolen.

This camera is amazing, I rarely use my DSLR anymore since I bought it. Let me sum up the advantages:

1. Incredibly build quality, very solid, made of metal.
2. Perfect photos every time, never messes up exposure or gets the colors wrong.
3. Shoots in RAW, so you have a lot of control.
4. Very easy to change manual settings. Control ring is awesome.
5. Depth of field is much better than any other point and shoot I have used. Makes photos very interesting and they look professional.
6. Small size is great, you can bring it everywhere because it actually fits in your pocket.
7. It&apos;s FAST, it can shoot photos rapidly and there is no delay when you press ... the shutter to when it snaps the picture.
8. The detail is incredible even in auto mode, I edited over a dozen photos in Lightroom 3 before I realized they were all JPEG and not RAW.

Seriously don&apos;t be put off by the price, it&apos;s worth every penny. It&apos;s one of those purchases where I am 100% satisfied and would much rather have the camera than the money I spent. In fact, I refuse to buy a cheap camera again. I would rather not have a camera than use anything less than this one.

     <Review>Pros: Oversisded CMOS sensor, Lens speed, image quality, battery life, low light results, easy settings with lens ring..

Cons: Would like to see panoramic sweep and burst shot capability.

I am a marketing consultant for many industries but a large part of my focus is in the medical community where web sites, printed materials, articles, etc. are a must. This means on the spot shots of exam rooms, staff doing things, waiting room or procedure room shots on the fly. I have many cameras as I used to be a full time pro some years ago. Nothing has ever come close to the performance, quality and clarity of the images that come out ot the S95. For more demanding work I also have a Canon 50D, Canon G-10, Sony SDSC-HX5 and a closet full of film cameras with over 30 lenses. (I stil use ... film in some special instances) but the one camera I carry with me at all times is the S95.

Low light situations tranform into soft glowing crystal clear images without flash. Easy to change manual settings on the fly with the lens ring make using this camera a snap. Best of all the battery offers great life use on a fully charged status and the SD cards for memory are a blessing. While my Sony can do some trick stuff I wish this Canon could do (ie: stitched images on the fly, plus panoraic sweeps and burst shots at many frames per second) I still cannot get the quality images this Canon presents. This means a lot less post edit time at my computer.

If you&apos;re looking for a small easy to carry nearly pro pocket camera the S95 is your choice. The FAST 2.0 lens was a dream just a year ago and now they&apos;re slowly becomming a bit of a standard for premium pocket cameras, but nobody quite measures up to the quality of the Canon lens and I&apos;ve tested them all. WIth an oversized CMOS sensor even a pro like me will be impressed with the performance. I love it when a camera company sits down and figures out how to make the best camera they can for a reasonable price instead of the lowest priced camera with reasonable performance.

Best $400 you&apos;ll ever spend .... if you can find one. wr

     <Review>Being a DSLR user I was looking for P&amp;S that would let me decide the settings in the camera to get the desired exposure and look. This camera does just that. With a large sensor in a small ( about the size of a deck of cards ) body, There is a lot of imaging capturing power in this pocket size camera. And when the wife wants to use it she just puts it into auto and can still captures impressive shots. Shooting at ISO 1600 with no flash is a big advantage with this camera and when using RAW it only gets better. Noise is very well controlled with the S95 and I have no problem capturing a clean shot at ISO 1600. This is a great little camera with HD video available just to add to this great package.</Review>

     <Review>Pros: Style; Quality of images; Size

Cons: Pop up flash; Can be slow between pics

The reason why I came to Buydig was because their price for the camera was comparable to what I had wanted to pay from my initial research elsewhere. I had already done my research on the Canon S95 and knew this was the camera I wanted. So a word of advice: do your research before you buy.

The S95 could probably be considered the amateur&apos;s SLR. I&apos;m not a professional photographer, and admittedly I&apos;m not sure I can use this camera quite to its full potential. My last camera was a DSLR that my father gave me as a gift, so I have some experience with higher end cameras. Though I liked the DSLR, it is just too unwieldy.

The first thing you might notice about the camera is its size and ... build. It&apos;s got a slightly textured surface, weighs little and feels sturdy. The main dial on top is firm and won&apos;t be shifted accidentally (like how my other camera&apos;s dial was). Buttons are raised on the back of the camera for ease of use, while the ones on top are flush with the body, except for the shutter. All are immediately responsive and feel good. The only qualm people might have is that the pop-up flash might encroach on finger real estate. My fingers are slender, so there&apos;s enough space behind the pop-up flash for me, but others might find it a little awkward to place their fingers on the camera around the flash. If you think that might be the case, try before you buy.

This camera has a lot of settings, but what I like most is the ability to change shutter speed and aperture with just the slightest turn of a dial. My old camera had me jumping through hoops to do just that. There are 9 settings on the top dial including: Auto, Potrait, Custom, Manual, Program, Aperture Priority, Shutter Priority, Low Light and Standard (for videos). There is one setting ring on the front of the camera surrounding the telescoping lens, and another surrounding the multi-function button to the right of the LCD. Depending on the program, these rings do different things, including changing aperture and shutter speed.

I haven&apos;t had a chance to explore all of the features of the camera, including Wink Self-Timer, Smile Detection, Face Detection, Color Swap, Color Accent or HDR (which more serious photographers might want to look into), but there seems to be enough here to satisfy everyone.

Besides the features and appearance, performance is what we really care about. People have mentioned the slight amount of time between shots as being longer than they expected and/or desired. If you&apos;re not patient but are thinking of getting this camera, you might want to test this out at a local store before you commit. It doesn&apos;t bother me, but it might bother some. I&apos;d say there&apos;s a 2 second delay between pictures, not including whatever you have set as image review time. The only other thing that I&apos;ve heard is that battery life is lacking. I can&apos;t attest to that because I&apos;ve only shot a few pictures here and there and haven&apos;t tested the battery&apos;s full capability. Check that out before you buy if that&apos;s going to be an issue.

Pictures from this camera are very nice and crisp. I don&apos;t know how the colors compare, but they seem true enough to me. There are options for changing the quality of images, such as for using RAW Jpegs and such.

Overall, I&apos;d say I&apos;m very happy with this camera. I would definitely recommend this to someone looking for a high end camera, with a plethora of settings that they might find on a DSLR. Like I said at the beginning, it&apos;s the amateur&apos;s SLR. It has enough settings and high enough performance to probably become a professional photographer&apos;s backup when he/she doesn&apos;t want to take their SLR out. There&apos;s a lot here for almost any type of user, in a nice-looking tidy package, and in the end, you probably won&apos;t regret getting this camera.

     <Review>I usually shoot RAW, aperture priority, spot focusing, auto white balance, ISO 200 outdoors, auto ISO indoors, evaluative exposure. I limit the ISO to 1250, which, combined with f2.0 or f2.8 takes great pictures, without flash, in most indoor settings. This combo gives fantastic results, every bit as good (at least up to 8 x 10 prints) as any DSLR I&apos;ve had. It&apos;s stealthy, good for discrete shooting, It doesn&apos;t make people so self conscious. I don&apos;t feel so much like a camera nerd, (as our daughter has occasionally labelled me). I take the camera with me a lot more than I have taken a DSLR, usually in the front pocket of my jeans or slacks. No camera case or neck strap needed. I find the front control ring too hard to turn, and the back control ring too easy to turn. Like everyone else, I ... occasionally get my finger rudely pushed away by the rising flash. After exhaustive research I&apos;ve found the best way to avoid this is to not put my finger on top of the flash when I activate it (the flash that is). I really like this camera. Bill

     <Review>Pros: Great image quality from a small sensor camera, high quality build quality.
Excellent low light capability
Flexibility to be a point and shoot camera, but also allows full manual control.
Light weight compared to my full frame DSLR Canon 5D II, or even my Sony NEX 5
Allows capture of RAW (digital negative) which allows greater flexibiity in post proessing.

Cons: Front rotating ring can seem abit gimmicky.
Video is great but these days should offer full 1080p res, and not the 720.
Battery life may be limited as the big screen LCD display will no doubt be draining.

One of the best point and shoot cameras on the market. If you decide to purchase a digital camera this year, you should seriously consider the Canon S95 as one of your top 3.

     <Review>Pros: Size; Features; Screen; Picture Quality

Cons: Battery life

This camera is awesome. The pictures look better then they do in real life. Great contrast, vivid colors, low noise, sharp images. The low light mode is a bit of a disappointment at only 2.5 Mp But just switch to manual mode setup a tripod and get the same shot. Everything about this camera impresses me. If I have to pick anything negative I&apos;d say. The battery doesn&apos;t not last long. But I picked up[...] And its tricky to figure out how to make the flash go down after it pops up.</Review>

     <Review>I&apos;m usually a DSLR shooter (7D). But, I have carried around a Canon G9 in a backpack for a couple of years, assuming I would use it for day-to-day photographic opportunities. But, of its size, it was in a soft case that was in a back pack all the time. So, I was looking to replace it with a more pocketable alternative. I debated for months between the S95 and Panny LX5. I love the 24mm lens on the LX5, but I ultimately went for the S95 because I knew with it&apos;s small size, I could always have it in a coat pocket, ready to pull out on a second&apos;s notice. I have not been disappointed with my decision. It&apos;s already served it&apos;s purpose as a ready-at-all-times camera. Probably my biggest surprise with the camera is it&apos;s high-ISO image quality. I am amazed at how salvageable ISO 1600 and ... 3200 images are with Lightroom noise reduction. I feel like this camera delivers the same level of noise as my first Digital Rebel XT, although without the same dynamic range and color quality. My only complaints are lack of control over AF point location and lack of manual control in movie mode. If you&apos;re an experienced photographer, looking fora good camera to take everyone, you can&apos;t go wrong with the S95.

     <Review>I normally shoot Nikon DSLR. Learned photography on a Nikon FE and never looked back. I have been dreaming of a decent camera that fits in my pocket but allows me full exposure control when I need it. The Canon S95 is that camera. Fits in your pocket yet has all the manual features you would expect from a larger camera. The front control ring is too cool. The f2 aperture doesn&apos;t hurt too. Though I do miss having a viewfinder, the screen is gorgeous and shows a preview of the exposure even before you shoot. The fact that the controls are so simple made this an even better deal for me. I took it on a scenery shoot last week and ended up using it as much as my Nikon D200. The auto features do spoil me a little???I end up not having to worry much about setting it manually, as it t ... akes very good photos in automatic mode. I tried the HDR feature???useless of course without a tripod. It&apos;s quite simple to set it to HDR and well, you just point and shoot and it does the rest. Video at 720p is nice, and audio is better than my FLIP. Not too happy about the flash, but hey it is a Point and Shoot, isn&apos;t it. Besides, I rarely get to use the flash. Very happy with this camera, get it, you will be too :)

     <Review>If you are a photographer and need a P&amp;S around, this is the one. Great image quality (considering its size), fast f/2.0-4.9 lens,usable ISO range of 80-800 and manual controls with a ring around the lens to control any setting like ISO, exposure, aperture and shutter speed. I got good results shooting in extreme low light conditions and the video quality in 720P is outstanding for this little camera. The battery life is not bad but I recommend buying an extra to be sure. It&apos;s pricey but worth every penny. Only two point disappointed me: no auto focus and no zoom during video recording. You need to set the focus and zoom prior to record. If you need a pocket size camera with a huge range of features and settings, manual controls and excellent image/video quality don&apos;t look elsewher ... e, buy it.

     <Review>As an avid photographer and semi-professional, I&apos;ve yearned for a point and shoot camera that I could easily fit into my pocket but also give me the features I expect cameras to have in today&apos;s media-crazed society, i.e. HD video and a big sensor for top notch photographs. The Canon S95 delivers on both. THe design is nearly flawless. The picture quality is fantastic and the HD video is nearly as good as some of the high end video cameras I&apos;ve used as of late. The various modes give you the option to shoot wide angles, HDR, landscape, portrait, scenes, etc. The manual zone gives is photographers the chance to manually dictate the type of shot we want. This camera is great in low light and the zoom function, couple with the manual focal selection ensures that you&apos;ll always be able to c ... apture the shot you want. For such a small package, the Canon S95 performs as a high end DSLR at a fraction of the cost. I&apos;d recommend this camera to not only professionals, but also regular camera fanatics who are looking to snap pictures to their hearts content. Go and get yours today!

     <Review>Pros: Ease of use, Picture quality

Cons: Price...but it is worth it.

I purchased this camera to replace my Canon S90 which I left in a hot car and ruined. I didn&apos;t see how the images could be any better with the S95 but they are. I am a retired professional photographer and carry it everywhere I go. You wont know it is in your pocket. Out of curiosity I took identical photos with my Nikon 7000 DSLR and the S95 and compared them. Even at extreme enlargements there is no difference in the images. The Nikon cost over one thousand dollars without a lens. I love the Canon and am considering purchasing another one to put away in case this one ever goes bad.
Images are crystal clear, perfect color, great low light (I seldom need to use the flash) and easy to use.
I have used a ... lmost all other brands at one time or another and Canon beats them all for my needs.

     <Review>I&apos;m a Nikon shooter when it comes to pro-level cameras, but I have to give Canon a big pat on the back for its point-and-shoots. This is the third one I&apos;ve owned and they just keep getting better. Started with an A550 in 2005 and bought my lady friend an SD1300 that&apos;s fun to use (but since it&apos;s pink, I try to leave it for her. Guess I&apos;m not all that secure with that kind of thing, huh?) I read many reviews and was leaning toward the G12, but liked the size of the S95 better. The reviews seemed better than the newer S100, too. I&apos;ve used it for several weeks now and while the ergonomics are still a little cumbersome, I&apos;m getting more familiar with where the buttons and features are. Only real problem is continually putting my left forefinger on top of the pop-up flash, but since I rar ... ely use flash, it&apos;s not that big of a deal. I&apos;ll learn! And speaking of flash, having two stops plus and minus worth of flash exposure is thrilling! I shoot the camera in program mode most of the time to control the flash so I like the ability to assign certain functions to the buttons or the ring at the base of the lens -- that makes accessing certain often-used features more quickly when needed. I set white balance and particularly custom WB often, and it&apos;s a breeze. Plus seeing the changes on the LCD are most helpful. I really like how this camera feels and works and am glad I bought it! Just wish it had a real viewfinder. Yes, kids, we geezers need viewfinders!

     <Review>I have been shooting with DSLRs for about 3 years now. Starting out with a Canon T2i and then to a Canon 5D and now to a Canon 5D MK II, but sometimes I just want a small point in shoot that I can carry around in my pocket. The Canon S95, does just that. I have an iPhone but this thing blows it away, obviously. First off, the features. It shoots HD video along with high quality images. If you set it to full manual you have access to white balance, iso, aperture, shutter, and many other settings. There are lots of in camera options to give you some simple photoshop effects. The ISO bumping could be great so you can take shots without flash. I love this point and shoot and it&apos;s nice to have something that is not huge but still provides great images!</Review>

     <Review>Very pleased with the picture and product quality. Minimal need for touching up photos in general and red-eyes in particular. Flash vs lens positioning is such that I have not seen any red-eyes yet. The S95 can be set to full automatic and used as a simple point and shoot by the most inexperienced users in the family while allowing more experienced users the control they need via many of the settings found in DSLRs. The control ring and custom settings mode are convenient features that increase useability. One weakness is the video function which is of limited use due to the lack of continuous focus/zooming while filming. All-in-all, the S95 captures great images and is a completely viable alternative to lugging the DSLR kit when size and portability matter.</Review>

     <Review>Like everyone else looking at this class of camera, I was looking for optimum image quality in a small form factor, for occasions (especially those occasions that tend to be indoors, and often under low light conditions...like weddings, social gatherings, etc.) when bringing my dSLR (a 40D) along was simply not practical. Previously, I was often getting by at such times with my G9 and a small flash, but even that was sometimes too big of a kit to bring along-- it required a separate bag, and was large enough to be noticeable. Plus, its image quality (with flash, indoors) is great, but it is rather slow in terms of focusing and shutter lag. I also have a Panasonic ZS6, which is a GREAT compact (similar to ZS5 and ZS7) with a great zoom range for full daylight, but it struggles indoors. So ... when prices on the S95 fell to truly low levels following the release of the new S100, I finally decided one more camera wouldn&apos;t hurt, and bought one. All I can say now is, I wish I had bought this camera even earlier, even at full intro. price, because I can think of a number of events over the past year where I just skipped bringing a camera altogether, where the S95 would have been absolutely ideal. It&apos;s unobtrusive, it&apos;s quick ENOUGH for most spontaneous shots, and it&apos;s shockingly good in low light (there is some noise in the shadows, if you look for it intently, but very little detail smearing even in JPEGs), while still retaining great color accuracy and saturation. The auto white balance does a great job on this camera. The control ring on the front makes it immensely flexible and quick to change settings. (Although the menu system is also easy and intuitive.) And to top it off, I can slip it in my purse (or, for the non-purse-carrying guys or gals, it will slide subtly into a pants or jacket pocket with no problem), so that it&apos;s there if needed/wanted, but out of the way otherwise. Now I get what all the pocketability fuss is about. I have quickly adapted to holding this tiny camera so that my finger doesn&apos;t interfere with the rising flash on the top left. The rear control ring and buttons might be a challenge for people with large fingers, but if you can send a text on a cellphone you can definitely learn to handle the S95. I have a Richard Franiec grip on my G9 and feel it is absolutely a necessary accessory on that camera, but the slightly rough finish on the S95 really does seem to be sufficient to allow a good grip, and I think it looks classy and svelte as-is. (The grip looks good, though, and might be a good idea if you plan to use this camera a lot on vacation and might be carrying it in your hand at-the-ready for long periods of time, to reduce the fatigue caused by squeezing/pinching a flat camera). At current prices, if you can afford to even be shopping on this website, the S95 is an eminently sensible purchase, and one you ought to make no matter what other serious camera(s) you may already own. Why do I say that? Because it excels at being a companion you can take along with you virtually all the time, that won&apos;t weigh you down or let you down. You will say wow quite often when you look at the images you can capture with it. You will miss fewer moments during the upcoming holiday seasons with your friends and family, because a) you can always have an easy-to-operate camera with pretty sensational image quality with you, and b) that same camera won&apos;t require futzing around with changing lenses, waiting for your big shoe-mounted flash to recycle, and won&apos;t give you those blurred shots you sometimes get because the depth of field on your (heavy and cumbersome) f/1.4 low light lens was too narrow and you or it missed focus. When you share pictures you&apos;ve made with the S95 with others, they will also often say wow, and also thank you. I think the S in the Canon S-series should stand for social, because this (and its line-mates, the S90 and S100) is really the perfect social camera. It gets the shot, and the shot it gets is really, really good. Buy it and enjoy it. Oh, and yes the battery...

     <Review>Pros: components, feel, image quality, price, speed, manual controls

Cons: zoom

I love Canons, particularly this camera. I have purchased two (one for a friend) There&apos;s a lot said about this model, and even after all &apos;the hype&apos;, I feel happy every time I boot the thing up.
What I&apos;ve noticed that I didn&apos;t gather from reviews, is that with the S95 I am taking less and less shots in &quot;auto-mode&quot;. The manual dials are intuitive enough that it is worth my while to get the shot right by my own eyes.
The only thing that seems to be lacking in this camera is some more serious optical focus. But I purchased this camera specifically for a trip up a coastal highway and for indoor (party) pictures.
The video and audio quality - also a big plus! And the last unexpected surprise wa ... s how easy it was to find great values on class 10 SDHC cards and so called &quot;off-brand&quot; batteries, that work just as good as the canon flavor.
Love this camera, enjoy!

     <Review>I bought this camera to help me teach a digital photo class. I usually use a slr, but most of my students use a point and shoot. Because it does not have a view finder, it is hard for me to focus on what I want. The flash also is located where you would hold the camera. But, the pictures are very good and it has lots of interesting features to play around with. It also has video and that makes the camera fun. The camera is small and good for taking pictures on the go.</Review>

     <Review>I bought this camera because it has many of the same features as an SLR, but it was compact. This is my second Canon Powershot. My older one is 6 years old and still going strong. I just wanted something more up to date. I am impressed with its picture quality, especially in low light and at a distance, using the zoom. The images are clear and not grainy. I&apos;ve only had the camera for about 2 months, so I haven&apos;t had a chance to explore all the features. I like the display in the back. it has a helpful reference which explains the feature. Video quality is very good, but can be shaky. I think it could be improved if you had a tripod. I miss not having a view finder, but am getting used it it. With the camera, you can control the exposure length and aperture. The only thing that I ... am not crazy about is the pop-up flash. It&apos;s right where your finger sits to hold the camera. In low light it comes up automatically. I&apos;m afraid it will break over time, or if the camera were to fall and land on it, it wouldn&apos;t survive the crash.

     <Review>Pros: Good Image Stabilization; Large Clear LCD; Good Image Quality

Cons: Poor Flash; Short Battery Life

I&apos;m still not comfortable with this camera after a few months of casual use. Granted I haven&apos;t taken as many pictures lately as I normally do. There just are some design/ergonomic issues that I haven&apos;t gotten used to. Depending on the situation I normally use a DSLR, or in the past an older Canon Digital Elph. I bought this camera as a higher quality replacement for that pocket camera.

A huge drawback for me is the flash. It pops up on the left top of the camera, exactly where I would normally put my left index finger. It sounds like a small issue, but I&apos;ve always held a pocket camera that way, and it doesn&apos;t feel natural to hold it differently. I&apos;m not sure why the ... y needed a retractable flash in the first place. What would be actually useful, is if they had a flash that could pivot vertically to bounce off of the ceiling. That would be worth the money.

Another design aspect I don&apos;t like is the body finish. Its sort of a matte or finely textured finish that is more grippy or friction inducing than other pocket digitals. With pocket cameras, you want to be able to quickly pull them out of your pocket &amp; slide them back in with ease. This particular camera doesn&apos;t do that for me. It takes more effort, which lessens the overall enjoyment for me. Maybe I&apos;m just spoiled. Maybe I need to stop wearing skinny pants. 

It does have great image quality &amp; a fantastic LCD. I wouldn&apos;t recommend this camera though. The great lens &amp; image quality don&apos;t make up for the ease of use issue. To me it&apos;s not worth the extra $200+ for the quality.

     <Review>Pros: Photo quality, Size, Options

Cons: Price may be too high for some

If you are looking for a point and shoot that you can easily carry with you, but want one that takes great pics, this is the camera for you. This camera takes amazing pictures and has both Auto and Manual options for beginners and pros alike. This camera packs a lot into a small package. Don&apos;t be fooled by the 10 megapixel label. This camera has a LARGE sensor relative to other point and shoot cameras. The sensor does more in picture quality than the megapixel number does. The larger sensor also helps it perform better in low light settings. Doing research, I read that when someone who normally uses a DSLR camera wants a smaller camera to stick in their pocket, the S95 is the camera they use. Don&apos;t be sca ... red by the price-It&apos;s well worth it!

     <Review>I use this when I am on the go camping or other where I cannot carry my backpack.I love the size.I do not love the results I get. I had hopped my wife could get good results on auto but nope! Even in auto and decent light she would get blury photos.My initial feelings for this camera were very high as it had so many features similar as my SLR and I initially reviewed it quite high at B&amp;H. However as I have used it for over a month now my 5 or 4 star rating is more like a 2. Why such a drastic drop? First the rating dropped from a 3 to a 2 because I feel more ripped off by the [$] cost as I see the problems this expensive camera has and they really are inexcusable. Some may say they are caused bue user error. Simply not the case.Here is a short laundry list of the problems I have ran ... on to that I did not see at first.1. When videoing the video will have some ghosting image go across the screen ??? the camera is not hot not the environment hot either. 2. The camera will randomly insert a date stamp as you take pictures. With the same settings without any changes to the settings whatsoever one picture will have a DS and the very next will not. I hate DS and do not prefer to remove them. IF you like DS it is still a bad thing because it apparently will turn off on you too maybe.3. Rapid shoot is atrociously slow ??? for [$] you should get at least 3/second even in RAW format4. I specifically have the camera set up for spot focus in the center of the camera and it will take blurry photos and when it does this it messes up the exposure generally also.5. The flash is on the most obnoxious place ever and when others have used the camera that is the first thing they say about the camera.6. The stereo microphones are in very bad places at the bottom of the camera and since the camera is so small (good thing though) you can&apos;t help but cover them with a finger or two as you hold it. By far if video recording use a pod of some kind. I still like the camera but if I had it to do over again I would go with a different camera. It is absolutely not worth[$]

     <Review>Pros: Durable, Size, Image Quality, Image stabilization, Low Light Setting, SLR type setting capability

Cons: Flash location

I LOVE this camera. I typically shoot with a Canon 40D but sometimes you just can&apos;t haul that thing around. This camera gives me all the great features but weighs a fraction of the SLR. I never leave home without it! It&apos;s been around the world and I have amazing pictures to prove it. The night shots are incredible with the lowlight settings, and the image stabilization helps on those fast train rides in Europe.
My only complaint so far is the flash location. I had to find a new way to hold the camera so I didn&apos;t block the flash from popping up. But worth it for the results!
If the pictures don&apos;t sell this camera the quality should! My husband left ... my camera outside and I found it three rainy days later. Not a drop of condensate in the lens or screen! I&apos;ve dropped it, smashed it into my luggage, and left it in the rain for three days, that&apos;s a pretty serious test to pass with flying colors!
Highly recommended to anyone serious about their picture taking. And a great tool to learn more about camera settings and functions.

     <Review>Pros: size and weight

Cons: Inconsistent color reproduction

Having read the hype I purchased this camera and it was the worst camera I have ever owned. I took a series of pictures within seconds of the same stationary object with the same settings, from the same position and same lighting. The reason I repeated the pictures is that each one had a different hue. Some had a pinkish hue, some with yellow, some blue grey. The pictures might be rectified on the computer, however one does not expect to have such inconsistency in color with a camera that costs $400. At that price range I would expect a camera to at least have consistant colors.</Review>

     <Review>Pros: Nice Feature Set, Small, Great Screen, Shoots RAW

Cons: Died after 2 weeks, colors seem a little flat.

I am a HUGE Canon fan so this review is a little hard to write. I bought this camera based on various reviews and its feature set. I especially like the fact that it shoots RAW. This was to be used as my carry with me camera since it is very small relative to my G11.

I had this for a little over 2 weeks and took a total of 12 pictures with it then this past weekend I went to take some pictures while out on a scenic ride and low and behold I was shocked when I got a &quot;Lens Error&quot; when I turned it on. I tried several times and got the same thing. I removed the battery and waited a while then tried again with the same error.

This camera was in a Lowepro prote ... ctive case from the second it came out of the box and it was never dropped or even bumped.

I brought it back to BB and they tried to tell me that it was outside of their 14 day return policy then said they would do me a favor and swap it out for me otherwise I would be looking at a restocking fee. I told them I am a Premier Silver Member and he said oh then you have 45 days and there isn&apos;t any restocking fee.

I considered getting another one but didn&apos;t want to take a chance having this happening again when I needed it to work. I looked at other options but decided to hold off for now.

Of the photos I did get / take with it I was impressed with the quality but the colors weren&apos;t very saturated and this was both in JPEG and RAW. The auto focus was very fast and accurate and there is very little shutter-lag.

Maybe I just got a lemon? I don&apos;t know but for something that I am not going to use every day I need to know it is going to work when I want it to so I decided to do a little more research.

     <Review>Pros: Excellent for av user,Fast/accurate auto-focus,Small / Compact,Good in Low Light,Large Clear LCD,Good Image Stabilization,Good Image Quality,Nice Body Color,Easy To Use

Use on world wide travel- Indoors &amp; out. Just received it . Have another Canon Auto Focus which is very good.

Tested most of the features. Everyone worked very well.
Photos were excellent! Indoor auto focus low light pics. were great.
There is little not to like about this camera. Ease of use, light weight, compact. quality build.

Flash location requires getting use to.
Battery life after extensive testing was somewhat limited. Would suggest purchasing a second one if you shoot large amounts in a single session.</Review>

     <Review>This is an easy to use compact camera It has improved image stabilizer comes in handy, so you can take photo with continuous shooting even on the bus. Auto-focus and colour output are good enough for casual use. I have no problem with short shutter lag on this one. The only thing needs to be concerned about this camera is the battery life Recommend purchase a backup battery. For pocketable camera, this is currently the best one to choose (size-wise)</Review>

     <Review>Pros: Speed, picture quality, size.

Cons: Price is high for a point and shoot--but fair based on the quality

I bought my wife a Lumix ZS1 last year to replace a Canon S80 (a predecessor of this camera) that she had accidentally crushed after 5 great years. She was quite disappointed. The Lumix is a fast camera, one of the faster point-and-shoots on the market, just not fast enough to capture quick shots of the kids, the little ones especially because they won&apos;t sit still. This camera&apos;s got speed to kill. Focuses and shoots faster than my Nikon D70 and my Nikon D200 under real-life situations (especially the more challenging ones with low-contrast backgrounds). It&apos;s good enough to leave the DSLR at home and not worry about missing out on great picture quality or speed--and it&apos; ... s extremely pocketable. Zoom range is phenomenal, low light performance far exceeds both my DSLRs, and it even takes great macro shots. Colors are rich and natural (makes the Lumix photos look rather faded, actually). I highly recommend this camera. Oh, yeah, and my wife loves it too--no more complaints. My only complaint is that I wish I had two of these--now I&apos;m stuck with the Lumix,

     <Review>Pros: Picture Quality, nice features

Cons: Battery life with video (but expected)

I&apos;m a photographer and love taking pictures but I don&apos;t always carry a DSLR with me at all time. I bought a Canon G9 a while back for more portability but it was still pretty big. Other point and shoots just didn&apos;t have the quality i was looking for but I bought this because it was a step below the G12 and but was much small. Reviews we very good so i bought it and was surprised at the picture quality. I was fishing in hawaii and took it with me and it took very vivid pictures. I like playing around with the features but there aren&apos;t many new functions that i haven&apos;t seen on other canon point and shoots. The ring takes a bit to get use to but is kind of nice if you can get the hang of it. Also I ... bought a 8GB SDHC Class 10 card and it allows me to record video without any issues. I would say the only issue i had was battery life with recording video but i expected that. I&apos;ll probably get a second battery so if i&apos;m doing a lot of video i&apos;ll have a back-up.

     <Review>So this little guy has been a great photo buddy. I own a DSLR and when I pull it out among friends they all run and hide, but with this little camera it&apos;s so small and portable that they don&apos;t mind posing for a few shots. Another great advantage is the size of this device! It&apos;s so small and compact that I can take it anywhere I go (as cliche as that may sound, I swear to you it&apos;s true). The disadvantage though to this product is obviously the price (but for me, to each his own I guess). You&apos;d figure they throw in extra items in the box but they don&apos;t even include the full camera manual. You&apos;d have to either download directly from the Canon site or another site that offers that choice. Also there&apos;s a way you can do manual focus on this camera but to be honest I personally don&apos;t think it ... really helps since it&apos;s all on the LCD unless it&apos;s real obvious (nothing beats a viewfinder). Concluding, this camera is great. Stick to Auto focusing (there&apos;s also this smart focus option) and you&apos;ll get great photos with or without the flash. Small, compact, and perfect for any occasion. The design is sleek and classy. I&apos;d recommend it tl;dr - Small, sleek point-and-shoot camera that produces great quality.

     <Review>Pros: Takes beautiful pictures, stepped up the video to HD from the SD90, nice feel to the camera

Cons: I can&apos;t lie, b/c of the price I was hesitant to buy it. But I&apos;m glad I did.

Imma keep this review simple and to the point. Awesome picture quality, very nice build. Doesn&apos;t feel to small where you may drop it often, yet its not bulky.

Has some nice features for the professionals out there as well as a good enough Auto mode for beginners.

Took some pictures of random things since I&apos;ve gotten it (including Mardi Gras parades here in New Orleans) and I&apos;ve posted them. Even though Best Buy crops them down so much you can&apos;t really enjoy the quality of these photos.</Review>

     <Review>I wanted a camera that I could carry in my purse or backpack ready to use whenever needed. I have a Canon 40D but that is just too heavy to lug around. This works great. I thought at first maybe the s95 was a little overkill with the complexity of everything one can do with it. But I find I like the extra controls that mimic a dslr. I am an artist who likes to sketch and paint en plein air (outside). I always like to take a photo of the scene when I am painting or sketching. I also like to take photos of my work at it various stages; having a little camera like this is very convenient. As a teacher I am finding it great to use in the classroom. I teach art to adults. I use the camera to take photos of their work as it progresses. I can take photos of my demos and send it to them a ... fter class. The uses of this camera limitless to me. I even take it with me when I go for a walk around the neighborhood. One never knows when a digital moment will show itself. I have not used the HD movie mode yet so I can&apos;t comment on it. I agree with most everyone else the battery life is not good but it isn&apos;t a deal breaker for me. I just bought an extra battery. When I use my dslr I can in some circumstance take up to 800 photos in less than an hour. I don&apos;t see me doing anything like that with this camera. The book says you can get 200 photos from a charge. I think I did a little better than that. The s95 will never take the place of my Canon 40D but it has allowed me to make photography something I will do everyday now.

     <Review>Canon S95 is the best shirt-pocket size camera as of February 2011, in terms of RAW image quality and all around ease of use plus manual controls. Nice new features like RAW files support, focus bracketing, and improved low light performance.</Review>

     <Review>Pros: Picture quality and manual control features

Cons: Ergonomics as noted

The image quality is as good as I had heard. No super fine jpg compression so for anything serious I recommend shooting RAW or JPG/RAW. JPG files are small for a 10mp camera, about 2.5 mb. Quality is still great.
Movie mode is very good for 24fps.....more than acceptable for casual clips. I would have liked to have seen at least 30fps.......but not a big deal.
Ergonomics however were disappointing. First, the shutter button is set in to the left and the mode control wheel is where the shutter button should have been, the result is a tendency to push the control wheel to take a shot. It does take some getting used to but if you are going to hand the camera to someone to take a shot you better mak ... e sure they know where the shutter button is, otherwise it will blow the shot or take too much time.
Second, the function wheel on the back of the camera moves way to easy without realizing it. On many occasions I have moved the wheel while holding the camera resulting in over or under exposing by 2/3 to 1 2/3. The fix here is to change the ring function to +/- which will change the exposure override to the front ring which is nice and tight and the ISO function to the back wheel, this way if you actually move it you are only changing ISO which is not as critical. My advice: CHECK THE SCREEN BEFORE YOU SHOOT TO MAKE SURE THE WHEEL HASN&apos;T MOVED.
Third, the pop up flash is a nice feature to reduce red-eye but it is located exactly where you hold the camera with your left hand. You have to move your hand when it pops up which is annoying.
Incredible small size for the quality you get....if you can get passed the above issues, this is the one......if not, look at the Canon G12or the Lumix DMC-LX5

     <Review>I bought this camera to serve me on those occasions where the bulk of my DSLR just wouldn&apos;t be practical. I have not been disappointed. It has excelled for me in low light situations, and the video recordings are very good. I added a small grip and always carry a spare battery. In my judgement, it&apos; s a lot of camera for the money.</Review>

     <Review>Pros: Low light capability, size, image quality and features

Cons: Battery life, limited zoom, not as clever panorama function as Sony

I was seeking to buy an enthusiast style camera that would allow my wife to pursue her interest in photography. She is a relative notice but has an appreciative eye. The menu system is great for a new learner and the manual and raw image capability provide room to grow. It is abour as small as you&apos;d want a camera and still be able to manipulate controls, in fact, it&apos;s a good thing they have image stabilization as holding the camera still while pressing the shutter is a challenge, but one that doesn&apos;t affect image quality.

It has already taken some of the best technical pictures and renders some great dynamics in color tone. In the attac ... hed photo zoom in on the Santa and you see some really nice gradation in tones and enough resolution to pick up dust specks. The f2.0 narrow depth of field is also great to have. The second photo of Christmas ornaments used a feature that blends three exposures to enhance dynamic range and solves proper exposure from bright lights to ornaments in the tree&apos;s shadow. We compared it to the Panosonic Lumix ZS7, Nikon S8100, and Sony NEX 3. The Sony NEX 3 did edge it out with image quality. The Nikon videos were disappointing, The Canon and Sony were much more consistent in getting a good exposure. In the end the Canon was much more versatile and easy to keep in a pocketbook for the unplanned inspiration.The Pansonic could not compete in the indoor light that makes up a lot of family picture taking. If we ever travel I would buy a back up battery. Would love a teleconverter to up the optical zoom.

     <Review>After much research and reading of reviews I finally narrowed down my choices for a fast point and shoot street camera. I normally shoot with DSLRs (Canon 50D and Canon 30D) and in China where I live this always scares off people in a big way. I needed something with a good wide angle and that also could shoot pictures in low light very well. I previously was using a Canon G9 and the camera&apos;s controls were very user unfriendly and always confusing to use quickly. So I was a little cautious and hesistant about purchasing another Canon compact digital although I love all of the other Canon products. Now about the camera...........SIMPLY AMAZING is all I can say about this camera. If your looking for a fast ultimate street camera you could not make a better choice in choosing this camera. I ... am very very picky about this aspect of cameras and this camera has far exceeded all of my expectation in terms of speed of autofocus, very very short lag time between exposures. Although you can&apos;t compare this to a DSLR, it&apos;s plenty fast enough to take multiple pictures of any moving subject. Initially I found the camera a little difficult and awkward to use because it&apos;s so small and I was consequently (still am......) accidentally pressing some of the control buttons when holding the camera. One small annoyance is that I am constantly accidentally hitting the on and off flash button which is situated in the lower most right hand corner of the camera. But the more I use the camera the more I love it and the faster I am with it. It&apos;s of course a trade off with having such camera this small because of course all of the controls will be much smaller than a DSLR, BUT this camera sacrifices very little in terms of picture quality. The photos I have test photos I have taken thus far have been under very difficult situations I have had nothing short of outstanding results. Most of the time reader&apos;s or photo review sample photos never show the kind of photos I like to take such as people MOVING and in very low light WITHOUT flash. This camera is SHARP SHARP SHARP at the widest opening and at very slow hand held shutter speeds. As a photojournalist I know that anything less than 1/250 for moving pictures results in very marginally sharp photos. But I shot many pictures all the way down to 1/20th in very low light and the photos were all perfectly sharp............and most importantly these photos were taken of people not stationary subjects. I enlarged the photos in Photoshop and was blow away at the EDGE TO EDGE sharpness of all of my photos when shot at the widest aperture.I shot inside moving trains and in very cold weather conditions outside and the camera performed flawlessly. The one downside of the camera is the very short battery life although as I mentioned before I was shooting most of my early test photos in very cold (NorthEast China cold.......-15 centigrade) conditions and now that I have returned to warmer climate in Beijing (0 degree centigrade.......ha ha ha) I find the camera battery life obviously a lot better although still very short. No matter. I just bought a lot of spare batteries and it&apos;s a small trade off for all of the other amazing things this camera can do. I want to say that when I first saw this camera it was hard for me to believe that such a SMALL camera would be able to take such amazing quality photos. But after I read that this camera had the same sensor as its big brother Canon G12, this is what sold me on the camera. I am not big on the pop up flash and I have always have to make sure my hand is not covering the flash to prevent it from popping up accidentally when taking photos. It&apos;s a minor annoyance though and I found the quality of the flash to be very good at times and iffy at other times. Now about the control ring....Canon definitely got this one right when they decided to create this very wonderful feature. It was a little awkward at first to use having to push first the button, choose the mode and then do whatever adjustment you wanted to make with the control ring, but once...

     <Review>I was looking for a small, powerful PS to augment my Nikon D70 (getting a little tired of hauling it around). I normally just take posed shots and scenery, so the speed of the D70 mostly isn&apos;t necessary. I would like more zoom, but i guess i can&apos;t have everything. I like the combination of easy PS features and control to manual set everything. As with most PS, the flash is weak. Love the size. Fits in the pocket easily. The battery life is short, but not horrible. Got an extra battery and that helps. The lag isn&apos;t bad and I don&apos;t miss too many shots. I&apos;m used to using a viewfinder, but I&apos;m getting used to not having it. Pros: -PS and Enthusiast features. -Small -Takes some good pics -Fairly fast. -Easy to use (if you don&apos;t get too caught up in the features). Cons: -Weak Fla ... sh -Zoom -Battery Life -No Viewfinder

     <Review>Pros: Compact size, great image quality, good ISO range.

Cons: Limited zoom

The Canon PowerShot S95 is a compact, feature rich camera in an impeccably finished package. Image quality from the 10 megapixel sensor is excellent and the anti-shake works very well. The 3-inch LCD display is bright and crisp and the camera has a usable ISO range of 80-800. Surrounding the lens is a control ring that can be set to adjust the ISO and focal length among other functions. For a DSLR owner, this is a great camera to have when a larger camera is not practical.

The zoom is somewhat limited, with a 28-105mm f/2.0 35mm equivalent
range. And there&apos;s a little distortion at 28mm. Also, the mode dial requires more effort to turn than most.</Review>

     <Review>very good point&amp;shoot camera. Shooting in low light [f2.0 lens], and in Raw are a plus. however, the raw file is not compatible with older photo editor software [unless i upgrade] other than the Canon photo editor software that came with the camera. The Canon photo editor software is OK. The 720p video is very good. I recommend having an extra battery though. Shooting in Raw or 720p vids depletes the battery rather quickly than jpeg shooting. I would have rated this camera 5 stars or &apos;excellent&apos; if Canon upgraded to 1080p. Overall, i&apos;m very satisfied with the camera. ...</Review>

     <Review>I&apos;ve had numerous point and shoot digital cameras, and a half dozen DSLRs, so have a decently broad point of reference for the S95. My hope, like this camera&apos;s supposed target market, was for a very portable P&amp;S with marginally better image quality and manual controls. In sum, it does deliver images with a wee bit less noise compared to other 10 mp P&amp;S cameras. It DOESN&apos;T improve at all on resolution. I found color rendition less than acceptable - with JPegs, reds and blues are oversaturated - even when the camera has been changed to neutral. The other big surprise was how the boxey and small size of the camera is really difficult to hold (I&apos;ve got medium to large size male hands). Finally, i found the camera&apos;s shooting speeds (focus to shutter release, and shot to shot) to be ... slower than my previous canon SD880. So, for the price (I paid [$]), i thought this just wasn&apos;t worth it, so i returned it. I&apos;m still on the search for that easily carried, more responsive point and shoot...am now considering the canon pwrsht 4000.

     <Review>I got my wife a Fuji F10 a few years back that she loved and used until it finally just fell apart. We were going on a trip and decided to get her a new camera at [...], so after some looking around, we chose the Nikon Coolpix S3000. Big mistake. Disappointing build quality, incredible slow in every way, and the photos were terrible.We licked our wounds and decided to research a bit more and make sure we got the right camera. After reading reviews for days, the S95 started to emerge as the current favorite among trusted folks, so we decided to pony up the extra money and get it.I so wish we had just bought this camera in the first place. It&apos;s got a great, solid feel; it&apos;s fast on startup, focus, and between shots; but most of all, the photo quality is top notch. I&apos;m a part-time profe ... ssional photographer, and I can honestly say that the photos this camera is capable of rival the quality I get from my 4 lbs of DSLR contraption I lug around everywhere.The lens is bright, fast and sharp. The LCD is huge. The optical zoom is adequate. Features like autofocus and image stabilization work quickly and as you would expect from a high-end camera. The components all seem to be top-notch.The video is very high quality and rivals DSLR video, but isn&apos;t fully baked yet -- no focus or zoom during shooting. It&apos;s too bad, because that could be a great feature.The S95&apos;s usability is really well thought out as well. In fully manual mode, the controls are intuitive and the options for tweaking your settings are plentiful and powerful. What&apos;s more important in my mind, being that this is a P&amp;S, is that the automatic mode is very smart, very simple, and will take great images within a second or two of turning on the camera. They&apos;ve hidden most of the manual features when auto is selected to avoid the whoa, what crazy configuration did you set up on this thing? questions. In Auto mode, the camera decides basically everything, and it&apos;s smart enough to make those decisions in a way that will produce great images really quickly.The only thing I don&apos;t like about this camera is the pop-up flash, but we&apos;ve gotten used to it already and it certainly isn&apos;t a big deal.Bottom line, this camera may be twice the price, but I would gladly pay the extra money just to have had this camera on the trips we took with that cheesy junk of a Nikon. We couldn&apos;t be happier with the S95.

     <Review>I&apos;m a Graphic Design student. I&apos;ve been using the product for small macro shots/video/other shots. The quality of the photos are amazing and all the random adjustment, make the possibilities endless. One thing I noticed after purchasing the camera was that there was no view finder. I know this was eliminated for a bigger LCD screen, but it takes the professional aspect out of the camera.</Review>

     <Review>I&apos;m an avid fan of B&amp;H, as well canon products. 3 weeks ago I flew into town to watch my brother run the NYC Marathon. I deliberately did not bring my Canon 40d as I had planned to go to B&amp;H to buy myself a good &apos;point and shoot&apos; for traveling. [ I love my Canon 40d but it&apos;s not always the most practical thing to be lugging around with you. ] My brother has the Canon G12- which I played with for a day and absolutely loved it. My only issue with it is I wanted something you can stick in your pocket and travel light with. The G12 is just on this side of large. Is slighly smaller than the body of my 40d...but about 1/3 size larger than the S95. Which is where we begin our comments. I bought the Canon powershot s95 for it&apos;s &apos;pocket-ability&apos;, not to mention I was told that it does ever ... ything the G12 does, [with the exception the G12 has a view finder, a swivel screen, adoptable lens and a hotshoe for a real flash. Not to mention the S95 was about a $100 less.]. Further more the S95 with gun-metal body and super sharp screen, was to good to resist. It&apos;s a beautiful looking point &amp; shoot camera. I took various shots around the city and then back home in panhandle of florida. I experimented with various lighting conditions; scene modes; subject matter; with flash on or off; with Iso settings; with program mode vs. auto mode. all in alI, took about 25 to 35 &apos;experimental&apos; shots. Guess what? 75% of my images were full of noise with super soft focus on my subjects! About every tenth shot I&apos;d get a decent crisp shot. Which made me think I wasn&apos;t using the camera properly. So, I&apos;d shoot some more.. alas, after further use and test shots, I feel that&apos;s simply not the case. i was extremely disappointed with it&apos;s results. Basically, if all you&apos;re going to print is nothing larger than a 5x7, and you just want something to capture the moment without worrying so much about how sharp the images are, then perhaps you&apos;ll be ok with the powershot s95. However, if you&apos;re a nut about sharp images [such as I seem to be...] you&apos;ll be disappointed in the Canon s95 powershot. If you have to play with settings so much to get the right scence on the right subject matter to get the right shot- then what&apos;s the point of getting a point and shoot? I might as well just bring my d40 out to play and deal with the weight and size issue. This morning I called B&amp;H to get my RMA number. I plan to exhange it for the G12. I should have stuck to my original game plan and bought the G12 from the get-go. true it&apos;s size makes it difficult to stick in you short pocket, but there&apos;s a lot less fuss- not to mention the sharpness of the images are terrific.

     <Review>Incredibly compact with large LCD viewscreen. I&apos;ve only used Auto mode so far but face recognition and backlight compensation are impressive. Color saturation and glare reduction look as if a polarizing filter was in place. Often, people pictures look better than real life. Shutter lag time could be better.</Review>

     <Review>I generally use DSLRs. Got this camera for it&apos;s RAW shooting capability combined with the small size (also liked the round the lens ring). So far I like the camera an have taken both candid and quick product shots of good quality. My only concern is that in RAW mode each frame takes forever to write on the card. Curiously, it&apos;s slow even In JPG mode : I have to give the shutter button a light press to revive the screen, which is otherwise stuck in photo review mode. I&apos;ll have to check all settings and also try the camera out with a SanDisk Extreme III (which I usually use an have had no speed Issues with) to see if issues persist...</Review>

     <Review>Was looking for a quality pocket camera and the S95 fits the exact qualifications I was looking for. Excellent size and form-factor to slip into a pants pocket, great low light performance and daylight shots. RAW shooting and limited HDR features are a plus as well. Pop-up flash can be a bit problematic if giving your camera to someone else to take a shot and they don&apos;t expect it. Also, quality LCD screen that make photo playback great to look at on the camera. Have had no issues with running out of battery, but an extra one and large memory card is always recommended!</Review>

     <Review>I had to buy this a bit sooner than I wanted when our aging cheap camera was lost and another broke. I got it based on Canon camera name/quality and top notch reviews for this and the S90. (The last Canon I bought was a 35mm film Rebel SLR.) Because of my immediate need, I didn&apos;t find any good discounts, and went with B&amp;H because of reputation and past experience. I&apos;ve only had the opportunity to use it for one real event so far (child&apos;s birthday), and my reaction is wow. The event covered three locations and included evening, night, sunlight, indoors, outdoors, and different lighting, and a few outdoor night shots for fun. For evening indoor shots, I had disabled the flash and forgotten that I had done so. I just assumed the camera did not need it, and it was taking superb pi ... ctures in ambient light w/o flash all evening. At night I turned on the flash and got adequate coverage in a very large room without light fall off at the far reaches of the image. I probably could&apos;ve gone without flash then too, but 10 year old boys move too fast for that! HD video in a Taekwondo studio under flourescents and outdoors looked great, with good colors and resolution. But that sure ate up battery and memory, so be ready for that. Outdoor shots the next morning under sunlight were excellent. Shutter lag is very short if prefocus is used. Image transfer to my computer was snappy, at the rate of 2+ images / second over USB. I&apos;m eager to try my favorite subject, mountain landscapes, in winter and summer, and try raw and HDR in that environment. For the regular family photos that I was able to try, it exceeded all expectations, and my expectations were high.

     <Review>The images are fine, but this camera have a weird ergonomic and an excess of buttons. The menus have too many options. Also the camera is not responsive at all. Slow focus, slow menus and slow shooting. Missed various moments. The battery won??t last a day of casual shooting. Have a dSLR camera and found they are way more easy to use than this camera. My wife and I prefered the practicality of the old SD800 camera. The camera is not very small and dont fit in a pants pocket.</Review>

     <Review>Nice little camera with lots of features. I have been looking for a high end point and shoot to carry with me at all times after missing some priceless shots because I didn&apos;t have my Canon 40D with me. I wanted a camera that would shoot RAW (thou Aperture doesn&apos;t support it yet), could fit in my pocket, take videos and deliver stunning pictures. This camera does all that and more. Great in low light also!</Review>

     <Review>This camera is amazing!!! Im a recreation photographer but like to do more than just pont and shoot i wanted a camera that had features of a point and shoot but also introduced me to the more complex features like adjusting apiture or adjusting the white balance. I love the color accent as well and the aging features the clarity is amazing. I have had many people comment on the sharpness of my photos. The size is fine and keep in mind im a large human with large hands. Having the new surface for better grip helps. This is my second cannon point and shoot. I&apos;d recommend this camera to anyone. I get so much happiness when im using it. I will go out and spend hours taking a ton of photos and just experiment with all of the features as well as sharpening my photography skills at the s ... ame time. It is well worth the price and I am 100% satisfied with my purchase after months and months of research. I&apos;m someone who will do a ton of leg work to make sure that I&apos;m getting the top of the line product and I know very well that I achieved that this time with the cannon S95!!

     <Review>Pros: Image quality, manual controls, size, build, HD video

Cons: HDR Mode

If you want a truly pocketable camera that gives you good image quality and full control over your photography, the S95 is an excellent choice.

I have closely compared this to the G12. Now, because my primary camera is a 50D, this is a back-up for when I don&apos;t want to lug a big camera and lenses around. You can&apos;t go wrong with either choice, but for me personally, the S95 was the one.

I took several pictures with both my 50D and the S95 and I was blown away of how similar the image quality is. I love all the manual controls that the S95 offers, in addition to being able to control them with the &quot;ring&quot; on the front of the camera. It&apos;s customizable, so you can adjust the zoom, aperture, ISO ... , exposure, etc, instead of scrolling through the menu each time to make changes.

The different scene modes are fun to play around with as well. You get a lot of camera for your money and I most certainly would suggest this to anyone in the market for a camera. If I have one complaint, it&apos;s the HDR feature. In my opinion, it doesn&apos;t work well at all. To get true HDR, you really need to take your images and use a software like PhotoMatrix or a plug-in for Photoshop. It&apos;s a first-time feature though on many cameras now, so like anything else, there is room for improvement.

     <Review>Pros: Picture quality, quality feel

Cons: A little on the expensive side.

I purchased this camera three days ago and even though it is my &quot;wife&apos;s camera&quot; I have taken many pictures and videos.
We have also looked at the S90 and of course it is an excellent camera...I use a Canon G11.

My wife noticed immediately the great picture quality particularly in low light without a flash. She sets it on automatic and it does a really great job. She also noticed (I did not mention this to her-came up with it on her own) that the camera body seems more tactile, easier to grip than the S90. Indeed the finish on the camera is different and really enhances the feel.

It also has an attachment on both sides of the camera so a neck strap can be attached. This may not seem like ... a big deal, but it really is - particularly when you are on vacation and want to keep the camera available without constantly holding it with one hand or putting it back in a case each time a picture has been taken.

My wife loves the small size and the flash is less obtrusive than that of the Nikon Coolpix 8000. For me, it is a little small in that my hands are bigger. I am ok with it but, it is not my first choice because of the size. It is my wife&apos;s first choice!

Item of interest; my G11 does not have HD and this camera does. The non HD video doesn&apos;t take a lot of memory card space, but the HD eats it up. I recorded about 30 seconds and the available picutre count went from around 2300 to about 1200. The video quality and the stereo sound are really nice, but it does eat a lot of space.

The display screen gets fingerprints easily because of the design, but that isn&apos;t a big deal in that it doesn&apos;t affect picuture quality. The flash does a good job for a small flash. The opitcal zoom is suficient and the digital zoom is fun to play with, but it isn&apos;t used that much.

The camera has a solid feel and appears to be constructed of metal. Good weight. No loose rubber tabs hanging from it. Feels like quality.

In summary, this camera provides great picutres in bright light and in low ...

     <Review>Pros: The best point and shoot picture quality available.

Cons: No fast continuous shooting mode.

I can&apos;t wait for this to come out so I can play with it!!! The image quality will be the same as the S90 in good lighting, but will surpass in low-light shooting. The images are incredibly crisp on the S90/S95 This is not an average person&apos;s camera, but it does have an auto mode. This camera has full manual mode for us advanced users, which is what photographers will be looking for. I believe that even this camera is better than the G11 mainly because of the 2.0 aperture(bigger opening to let light in through the lens) vs. 2.8 in the G11, so you can get brighter pictures in dim lighting. I am surprised that this only has 720pHD video instead of 1080p, but then I was surprised tha ... t the S90 and G11 only had standard 480p video. But overall quality, this is the best point and shoot pocket camera that you cam get

     <Review>I&apos;m an avid photographer of 33 years&apos; experience. I&apos;m getting weary of dragging my DSLR and lenses everywhere, but even more weary of missing great photos when I do. The Canon S95 is the answer. I use this camera as both a backup to my DSLR and as a carry-around camera for every situation. I rarely leave home without it. This little powerhouse produces outstanding images: sharp, clear, and colorful. It&apos;s especially adept at producing ambient, low-light images. It shoots RAW images as well as JPEGs and can be set anywhere from fully automatic and fully manual and everywhere in between. The powerful little zoom will take care of nearly any shot from a landscape or cramped interior to a beautiful portrait. Perhaps my favorite feature is the customizable control ring that can be set for almos ... t any adjustment, including focus. I use mine for +/- EV settings. The camera&apos;s tiny stature, making it truly a pocket camera that you can take anywhere, shouldn&apos;t fool you: This camera is a powerhouse. And its lens is as sharp as a tack, which may not be true for other cameras, including the S95&apos;s successor.

     <Review>Bought this camera to be our pocket and mobile option to our Canon T2i camera. And we are very impressed overall with it. Very easy to operate and, although being pocket, gives us a wide range of options and settings, like ISO, aperture, shutter speed, just like our reflex camera. Also, the pictures are very sharp and fully detailed. It has a fast and silent auto focus, possible also to do it manually. Shoots perfect in low-light conditions. It&apos;s body is in metal, making it very shock resistant. It&apos;s down sides are only the lack of a optical or even digital viewfinder and its short battery life, this being said, is highly reccomended the purchase of and addicional battery.</Review>

     <Review>I love my DSLR camera, but sometimes a pocket camera is more convenient. The PowerShot S95 is exactly what I need: full control, outstanding image quality, and extreme pocket-size portability! If you don&apos;t want to sacrifice pro features like RAW, exposure compensation, or manual focus, with the S95 you don&apos;t have to. Also the automatic settings and program modes make this camera easy for anyone to take great pictures. I&apos;ve only been using the S95 for a few weeks, but I am very impressed with it&apos;s usability, performance and the images it produces.</Review>

     <Review>I bought this camera in order to have it with me always, unlike my DSLR, which is too big to take everywhere. It is the perfect size to tuck into a pocket, briefcase or purse. It takes surprisingly excellent photographs within its limitations [small sensor, no telephoto]. The results are so good that one of the photos I shot in RAW with the S95 and printed at 8x10 is going to be in a photo show in the spring of 2012. I use it to shoot RAW images in Av, Tv or P mode all the time and am happy with most of the results. I notice that it has noise in low light, but I would expect that in a camera of this type and it can be corrected in Photoshop or Lightroom. The autofocus seems sharp. The only real downside to the camera is that it is slow to take pictures, so you can&apos;t just snap away when you ... have an active scene. The LCD is very sharp and clear even in very bright, high altitude sunlight, which was something I was concerned about before using the camera. I bought a Schott glass screen protector for the camera and am very happy with that.

     <Review>I use this product mainly while travelling and bought this as a replacement for heavy SLR gear. I didn&apos;t need the extra quality of an slr, but I needed to fit the camera in my pocket. This fits the bill, as I do keep changing setting a lot. I did not need zoom, but I can appreciate a fast lens. I got the s95 because I couln&apos;t get the S100. The s95 produces great colours though and I am happy with it. Battery life is also exceptional. I don&apos;t know how they do it, but it&apos;s nice not to have to recharge the battery all the time. Low light performance is ok, but I limited the auto ISO setting to max 800. Any more would be unusable. It could have been faster as well.</Review>

     <Review>The most import characteristic of camera is photo quality. Yes, maybe not very good display or bluetooth is important feature of camera for smb. If to compare cameras with similar price 
Canon PowerShot S95 of course will better, because another camers not provides such image quality. Another advantage of that camera is size. Another things are not critically important.</Review>

     <Review>Pros: Superior image quality, loads of features.

Cons: Controls in the back leave little room for single-hand grip.

My first shot with the new camera was indoors with the built-in flash. Distance to subject matter in the room varied from 10 to 25 feet. Image detail was sharp and colors were vibrant - a stunning photo. This camera has loads of features including many options to control the focal length, focus and exposure. It&apos;s a toy to be coveted.</Review>

     <Review>This is a fantastic camera. There&apos;s really no other point and shoot camera to consider. Great quality photos, all the features you need and plenty more and it&apos;s small enough to fit into your pocket. This often takes the place of my DSLR and I use this all the time.</Review>

     <Review>I lost my camera on a plane and after talking to one of the folks at b h. They recommended this camera. I had had a new cannon elph300 and decided since I had to replace it I might as well upgrade It is excellent I am a garden designer and I mostly photograph landscapes. This camera is small and easy to stick into my pocket or bag when I am on a job site. It has excellent features for shooting plants as well as video if I need to video a site while making comments. It is so much more than a basic point and shoot I am interested in learning more about basic photography and how to use all of it&apos;s features. Dislikes The position of the pop up flash. And that the manual is on a disk not a book.</Review>

     <Review>Pros: P&amp;S version of a DSLR, high quality pics, great low light vid/pics, full manual control, bright and fast lens for size

Cons: Pricey, max 720p vid (can&apos;t toggle zoom during Rec), and no touch screen

Pros
Fully customizable settings (aperture, shutter, wb, timer, flash, etc)
Great low light pictures
Great low light videos (up to 720p)
Many useful settings (I really like the &apos;miniature mode&apos;)
Sturdy build
Mic audio is exceptional for such a small unit
Bright LCD viewfinder
Has two lanyard hookups on the corners for neck straps (tourist style)
Fairly quick shots (startup to capture)

Cons
Cannot toggle zoom in once Video is in &apos;Rec&apos; mode
Lacking touchscreen
Menus can be tedious for new users - you get used to it after about 20 m ... in of use
Battery life may be short depending on your settings (I have 3 batteries and it isn&apos;t a problem anymore)
Built in &apos;pop up&apos; flash could get jammed if you&apos;re finger is blocking it (it takes a a few uses to get used to this mechanism)
No viewfinder (I would like to look through a lens rather than an LCD, call me old school, but I prefer this energy saving feature)
Pricey (maybe you could use a RZ coupon, like I did- 12% off 349.99)

Overall, I like it as a secondary camera to my DSLR T1i. If I don&apos;t have the space to lug around my DSLR, this one is just fine. I also have a SonyT900, TX7, and TX100v. I have come to enjoy touch screen cameras, but hate how they get scratched up and lose their clarity from sliding in my pocket and camera pouch. Having this camera allows me to easily place a touchscreen protector without worry of damaging the viewfinder. I find that the Sony tx100v and the Canon s95 are great cameras in their own respect. I was stuck in the middle, but in the long run, if you enjoy true manual control of the camera, the s95 is the way to go. the Tx100v is a great for touchscreen lovers and quick capture pics without the need to go through adv. setting menus. If I had to take wedding pics and had to choose from these two cameras... I&apos;d trust the s95. The quality of the pictures says it all.

     <Review>Pros: Amazing features in a small size

Cons: The provided wrist strap is too loose to be useful

I&apos;ve only had the camera for about a month now, but I&apos;ve extremely pleased with how well it&apos;s performed. The manual control and dual control rings make this a great camera for someone like me who wants some of the advanced features of a DSLR but without all the heft. My previous point-and-shoot went everywhere with me (an Elph, which I also loved), from mountain bikes rides to snowboarding out west, and it never missed a beat. With the S95, I have the same size camera, but noticeably better results. Even in auto mode, the ability of the camera to switch into macro mode and adjust the focal length to blur the background is a welcome plus. I was thinking that I&apos;d be adjusting the man ... ual settings all the time, but I&apos;ve found that the camera reacts very well to varying conditions so that I only have to take over control when I really feel like getting creative. Or, I can just be lazy and use the many scene settings to get great results. One of the biggest surprises though, was the built-in &quot;miniature&quot; mode which provides a tilt-shift effect in still mode and a stop-motion mini effect in the video mode. This is also my first HD video camera, and I&apos;ve been excited about the clips I&apos;ve been able to get. Obviously, a point-and-shoot isn&apos;t going to be able to deliver the results of a DSLR, but a DSLR isn&apos;t going to fit in your pocket! For me, this camera is fantastic!

     <Review>I use this camera to supplement the days I am not carrying around a DSLR. The camera fits in my pocket and I usually carry around a spare battery. The camera&apos;s macro feature is pretty useful, and of course, the camera&apos;s manual controls are a plus, which is also what the camera is popular for. Although, this is a great supplement, it&apos;s good to note that this is not a micro four-thirds or a DSLR, so make sure your expectations are of a point and shoot standard. With a point and shoot expectation, this camera is amazing. If your expectations are too high, you may be let down by limitations, like its DOF (due to sensor size), noise, etc. Also, I generally never zoom in under low light settings, as the Aperture suffers as you zoom in.</Review>

     <Review>Although I own a digital SLR (and an old Pentax film SLR), I bought the S95 to use in situations where a larger camera is not practical, or where I want to use a compact camera for convenience. I plan to use the S95 while hiking, which is the main reason I bought it. Some friends of mine who are semi-professional photographers recommended the S95. I have had it just a little less that 2 weeks. So far, it has been great. It is easy to use, and the picture quality is wonderful. I especially like the fact that the user can make all sorts of adjustments to ISO, focal length, shutter speed to suit the conditions. It is compact enough that it can fit in a shirt or pants pocket. I will be carrying it in a case that fits on a belt or on a pack strap. I do sometimes prefer a viewfinder, as LCD&apos;s ... are hard to see in bright light, especially with polarized sunglasses. I suppose the camera is too small for both the viewfinder and and LCD display. This is only a minor problem for me. I&apos;m looking forward to exploring more of the possibilities of this camera.

     <Review>Pros: Good Image Stabilization; Good Image Quality; Easy To Use; Large Clear LCD; Small / Compact; Fast/accurate auto-focus

Big Canon fan for years. I was very happy with my S80, upgraded to the S95 over a G12 and couldn&apos;t be more pleased. Outstanding image quality. For the casual user, even a picky one, the S95&apos;s compact size makes it an always-carry. Though I love my 50D, its bulk is a handicap. Five star camera.</Review>

     <Review>I am using this camera mainly for travel. It is so small and fit in my belt perfect. Now I understand why S95 is so expensive. Picture quality is amazingly. I set mine to auto all the time when I am lazy. This S95 picture quality many times rival mine Canon T2i. If you own any Dslr this little jewels is a good companion. Sometimes it even make me wonder,do I really need Dslar anymore:) The down side I really dont understand why Canon cut corner and not supply operating manual. They only give you starting manual basically tell you where to put battery and SD Card. Who doesn&apos;t know that? You can download manual on web site. I end up purchasing a book by Alexander S White to help me understand and learn more feature of Canon S95. Once again I will advise anyone look to buy best compact came ... ra Canon S95 is the one.

     <Review>Because I did not like the image quality, some years ago I stopped using little digitals and got a Nikon SLR. But -- the Nikon, although excellent, is not something I am willing to carry with me everywhere I go. This thing is. The color is fine, the auto functions work very well, low light pictures (I dislike flash) are remarkable. There is exceptional control for when I want it. The best camera is the one you have with you. And this Canon is small and light enough to take everywhere.</Review>

     <Review>Pros: good-quality images with ease of use

Cons: price

Purchased with little time to practice before vacation in Sweden. Practice was not necessary. This camera in auto mode has very discrete focus elements. Closeups with auto flash were excellent. Landscapes in dim light were well-balanced in fcal length and light. Indoor dim light at distances of more than 30 feet was the only difficult shot, but those shots are beyond the limits of the camera. In manual mode, without flash, time exposures were accepatble in dim indoor museum light.
Camera a little pricy, but I am happy with the versatility of the camera, it&apos;s compact size.</Review>

     <Review>I use this small camera for stills (AV mode is my favorite, followed by Manual) and home movies -- great HD movies. This size and form factor are terrific. Lens is wide and long enough-most small cameras are not wide enough for me. I have had a failure of the lens mechanism and am waiting to see whether the warranty will cover it. I hope so because it is my all time favorite small camera. I use a 20D for more SLR shooting.</Review>

     <Review>Bought this camera as a supplement to my DSLR camera. To be able to carry a camera for the unexpected, and for trips where I don&apos;t want to bring my DSLR. Nice and handy with good quality - exactly what I wanted and is exactly what I have got. The camera has a fast start, and has at nice and clear screen. Filming comes out with a good quality both in sound and pictures. Also easy to take pictures with low light. The pictures comes out in a nice quality, but with a low saturation. Batteries don&apos;t last that long.</Review>

     <Review>Pros: Easy To Use; Large Clear LCD; GREATclear LCD display; Nice Body Color; Good Image Quality; Good Image Stabilization; Good in Low Light; Small / Compact; Fast/accurate auto-focus

Cons: Poor location for flash; Macro focal-length averag; No Viewfinder

The Canon PowerShot S95 is a very nice compact pocket sized 10MP point &amp; shoot camera. The suggested retail is a little pricey but I believe it&apos;s worth the price compared to other cameras in this category (i.e. compact, pocket-sized digital point &amp; shoot). I bought my S95 as a bundle package which included many extras I would have bought sooner or later any way. So after I factor in the retail price of the camera with the added accessories, the over-all price for a camera bundle kit of this quality was fair and re ... asonable.

PROS: 
1) It is a Canon camera (&apos;nuf &apos;ced? - LOL). I&apos;ve had GREAT luck with the results from all my Canon cameras I&apos;ve owned and used cameras back to the days of SLR&apos;s and/or point &amp; shoot film cameras. 
2) Takes bright clear sharp (natural) colorful pictures in all lighting conditions and has a stunning LCD display (461K pixels) which is almost double the LCD pixel count compared to the average digital point &amp; shoot providing incredibly crisp and sharp images. Most LCD displays on cameras in this category (that I looked at) typically averaged 230K pixel count. One of the reasons that make the 461 LCD pixel count important (to me) is when you take a picture, when viewing it on the LCD display, as you zoom in or out, the image on the LCD stays sharp and focused with little-to-no pixelization and virtually no motion blur with great contrast and nice dark blacks, providing a pretty decent sample of what to expect the full blown picture to look like when viewing it on your PC or viewing the final printed photo. 

CONS: 
1) My biggest complaint (so far) is the location of the pop-up flash. It is located on the top left front corner of the camera where I place my left index finger when preparing to take a picture (and where I would tend to guess is where most users also place their left index finger). However, a few times after the flash pops-up and you feel your finger in the way, it was surprisingly to me how easily I remembered that could happen again, and made a conscious effort to just move my left index finger towards the back of the left top corner and avoided the flash popping up hitting me finger. I would have also liked a view-finder (but NOT at the expense of increasing the actual camera size), larger &quot;optical zoom&quot; (even though so far, every picture I&apos;ve taken using the zoom, came out amazingly clear and sharp with very little, if no pixelization at all) when blown up. Lastly, I would have liked the Macro focal length to be better. I looked at some other model cameras with a Macro focusing range from 0.4 in. – 1.6 ft. The S95 range is from 2.0 in. – 1.6 ft.

     <Review>I have been holding of buying a compact for serveral years as I thought the image quality would not be worth it compared to a DSLR. This camera did not change that, but I admitt the usability and size is nice. In use, the controls on this compact is great. Putting it in manual mode its easy and fast to control the ISO/aparture/shutterspeed. I&apos;m glad I did not buy the G12 with the slower lens. Images look pretty good when viewed small. This is a great camera that my girlfriend can borrow as she does not like using my Nikon D300.</Review>

     <Review>The small, lightweight design makes this camera perfect for me to carry in my work bag or purse to grab shots of those random moments in the city. I love that it has the ability to go (almost) go completely manual, but the auto settings always give me great shots as well. I would recommend this camera to an amateur photographer who isn&apos;t ready to spend $1000+, or as a back-up, incognito camera for someone with more experience. Haven&apos;t had much need for the video as of yet, but will try it out on my vacation. The pop-up flash is a little oddly placed as it is located where you might put your left had to stabilize the camera when you take a shot. I got great night time shots of fireworks during the 4th of July weekend, which I was rather pleasantly surprised with.</Review>

     <Review>Pros: Bright lens and full manual control

Cons: Nothing

For a point-and-shoot this camera will satisfy both the novice and the semi-pro. The best camera is the one you have with you and this Canon is small enough it can be with you all the time. It has great automatic features but can be switched into a fully manual mode so you control everything! Aperture, shutter speed, ISO, etc. Nice bright lens and exceptional picture quality.</Review>

     <Review>This is a beautiful little camera. Photos are noticeably better at wide end of the zoom, where the fast lens is crisp and accurate. Excellent, straightforward controls -- however some settings too easy to change accidentally. I&apos;m most impressed by the video, having 24p HD video in such a tiny package is a game-changer.</Review>

     <Review>Compared to the even lower cost Casio ES12, outdoor photos were comparable. Low light, however, this Canon is incredible for the price. Hardly needed flash; important since many of my shots are during church services. The HD video is even more remarkable in low light, and the sound quality is fine. Easier to use than the Casio, I also like the option to focus myself with the outer ring. Be sure to read the PDF manual on the (included) disk. The paper one is not enough. I am still working on the focus. [...]</Review>

     <Review>I am still learning, but I do some macro and some landscapes and street photography, all mainly outside in natural light. It excels in macro and it has amazing low light capability. It gives you a lot of control. It is small and inconspicuous and easily pocketable. The zoom is a real drawback. The battery is a minor drawback.</Review>

     <Review>I have owned so many digital point and shoot cameras including Nikon, Lumix, Panasonic and various Canons including G11. I love G11 though. it&apos;s just too heavy and big for my purse. I like to take every day life impulsive photos. S95 just great for everything. Perfect for automatic point and shoot, exactly same photo quality as heavy G11. but super light and compact! So many different &amp; cool scene options. love vintage, miniature, poster effect etc... also I can change functions manually depending on what kind of photo I want to take. this is just THE GREATEST small digital point and shoot camera ever so far! love it!</Review>

     <Review>when the BH sales associate told me that it was worth every penny and that it was probably the best point and shoot camera on the market, I was excited yet hesitant to see what this camera had to offer. In the past I&apos;ve tried Sony, Nikon, Pentax and other Canon products, and have always felt that Canon had an edge in terms of practicality and quality (not necessarily coolness). But taking this camera and trying it out on my vacation was excellent. The camera shoots in and displays photos with HD quality, and the colors and images are sharp and vibrant. It has a motion sensor, so that people without steady hands like me, usually always have crisp images. The difference in my last camera (Canon SD900) are very surprising, having a wow factor. It does have a lot of options (including ma ... nual settings) that have yet to be tried out, but many of the effects that you look for (such as fish eye, or low light conditions) are all included in this camera. Video and sound quality are equally amazing, and the overall ease of use is worth every penny. Because of the range of options and capabilities, it takes time to absorb the range of this camera. The user manual comes on a cd and is 150+ pages. But purely based on photo quality and ease of use, this camera is a definite buy for those who are serious about their photography but not serious enough to buy an expensive SLR.

     <Review>You cannot get a better pocket camera than this one. The lens is very fast (2.0), which allows you to take pictures in low light. The high ISO also works very well (up to 1600 is great for my taste). It has all the manual controls and a very handy control ring around the lens. I wish the battery would last a bit longer (200 shots is the stated battery time), but it should be enough for a day out. For a camera of this size, you cannot beat it.</Review>

     <Review>This P&amp;S is Awesome! I use the S95 to take pictures and videos at various events and just for fun. While I am not a professional photographer, the S95 turns me into one. It automatic mode is incredible producing flawless pictures in any environment. You will not find a P&amp;S that is better. I promise. My S95 recently spent time at the 2011 New York International Auto Show and I could not be happier with the results. Things that are great: 1. Takes Incredible Pictures 2. Allows you to take full control with manual controls 3. Many great built in effects 4. Stylish Look 5. User friendly interface/buttons &amp; controls 6.POCKETABLE!!! Things that are not so great: 1. For the price...it should come with a basic case at the very least. I ended up purchasing a Boblbee Aniara case for ... my S95 and it is perfect!

     <Review>Pros: Picture quality, versatility, manual settings, artistic photo modes, macro function, video mode, size

Cons: Inconvenient location of pop-up flash, battery life, sometimes confusing controls

I purchased this item for general photography when my 7D would be too hefty or to conspicuous for the environment. I work often in developing countries as a physician and hoped it would be suitable for pathology photos and training purposes as well as snapshots on day travels. The camera has exceeded my expectations. The photographs are high quality and the macro function very useful. It took some time to learn the controls, but it has the flexibility I needed for multiple purposes as well as great functions I was not aware of for artistic use. I compared it to my 7D for night photog ... raphy (&lt;30 second exposure) and found that , sadly, I liked the photos from the S95 better the majority of the time. Although I was reluctant to pay the hefty price for a point and shoot camera, it is the best purchase I have made in years.

     <Review>Pros: Large Clear LCD,Good in Low Light,Good Image Quality,Good Image Stabilization,Small / Compact,Easy To Use

I bought this cam because my old Canon Ixus40 (2004) is out of time. I read several reviews, test artciles and checked some comments on youtube. Finally I went to a store to check it out in real.
I just gonna mention the spots of bother, because any further comments on the picture quality and so on will be just a repetition of all the previous comments and articles. In one sentence: Image quality is very good, manual options are great, you can change aperture, ISO, shutter speed and whitebalance manually.

1. I just can recommend everybody at first to check out the handling of the cam. The scroll wheel is partly hidden inside the casing and the force you need to ... rotate the wheel into the next position is unusual high. With freshly creamed hands like on the beach, or sweating skin during summer it might become an issue.

2. During the first test-shots I tested the flash and I must say the mechanism to pop it out is quite strong. It can easily lift your left index-finger while holding the cam, so the first time it happend to me I wanted to decrease my finger-pressure on the case at the flashs place. But in the same moment I felt how the cam was turning already to fall down. I grabed it in that second a little bit stronger preventing it to slip out of my hands. 
So I think this can easily happen to someone who is not familiar with that cam and wants to shot in the automatic mode. You must be cautious about using the flash.

3. Unfortunately the design-guys have changed the side-edges to a rounded shape. That&apos;s why you cannot place the cam vetically on a table for example to take a pic of yourself by using the self-timer. It falls forward on the objective (because of its weight). So you need to stabilize it by putting something slim enough between the objective and the table (a nokia 6300 fits quite perfect;) ).

4. The strap to secure the cam to your wrist doesn&apos;t have any &quot;zipper&quot; to tight the strap. It remains loose. My old Ixus40 does have this &quot;zipper&quot; on the strap. You can tight it very well to the wrist and you can even drop the cam from your hand by holding your arm down. The strap stays on your wrist-that&apos;s how it should be always!

Despite from these 4 points, I like the cam and I gonna keep it, because I cannot find any different cam, which makes so nice pictures by being so slim.

This is a great camera! I bought mine from Adorama and it didn&apos;t include the owners manual. The manual can be downloaded as a PDF file- all 192 pages, and printed on 8 1/2 by 11 inch paper (one sheet per page). I didn&apos;t buy a compact camera intending to lug a reprinted manual the size of a very large book.</Review>

     <Review>I bought the camera initially for a trip to France and it??s main use will be as an underwater camera (just bought the Ikelite housing). During the trip, the usual pocketability of the camera allowed me to take it everywhere. And it really means everywhere. I ride bicycles a lot, and having a camera I can really pocket makes a huge difference. This is a very compact camera, without anything really protruding (except just a tad of the lens). Of course it is a great camera, technically: RAW support, fast lens (only at it??s widest though), decent wide-zoom ratio, manual exposure controls and manual focus. The front ring is very comfortable, for manual focus (I don??t use it much really), and I loved it for changing amongst lenses (you can use it to step through zoom levels identified as va ... rious lens lengths). The rear ring is ok too, allowing you to cycle through the different settings. Menus and usability is very good, at least for me. I really like Canon point and shoot men system, but it is a bit of a personal thing. You should try for yourself. But out of the many cameras I have tried, Canon is good an easy to use. At least once you get used to it, you can be rather fast at changing settings (which is important on a point and shoot). The feel of the camera is just right. The texture is very good. You feel it is a sturdy camera with very hight quality finishing. It also feels great (and securely gripped) in your hand. The camera is very fast at being ready to shoot. It takes very few seconds to be ready for action, lens extended et al. This is very important in a pocket camera. Regarding image quality, you can surely look up samples and more technical reviews elsewhere. Even though it??s low light performance has improved a lot (compared to mi SD750 for example), I still find small cameras to be disappontingly noisy. My biggest disappointment though, is the lack of a fast 2.8 setting at medium length lenses, like 35mm. I don??t like wide angles at all, so I get hit a lot by never being able to use the fastest aperture. Overall, it??s a great little camera. I truly believe if you are going to own more than one camera, get the smallest, and the biggest .I have a 5D and the S95. In betweens are just too bulky and not flexible enough. If you are considering the S95, also think about the Olympus ZX1, which is also very nice, and offers you a faster lens with better apertures all around.

     <Review>I use this to throw in my purse or diaper bag to have on hand to take pics of the kiddos when I don&apos;t feel like bringing my DSLR with. I like the size and the fact that I can shoot in manual if I choose to. The picture quality is really good in my opinion. I also like that it has HD video to capture videos on the go as well. The shutter lag exists, but to be expected with a point and shoot. I am very happy with my purchase so far!</Review>

     <Review>Always wanted a Nikon SLR, and multiple lenses. Didn&apos;t have 3 grand, and it requires lugging around a large piece of equipment at times when it&apos;s not wanted. So, I decided to start small, and I was amazed what a small camera can do now. Bought a pouch to carry it and protect it when out hiking. Took pics of 3/4&quot; flowers with no problem, no blurr. I shake alot, but this camera has no problem getting a good pic. I like the sequential shooting mode so I can just keep firing. 15x zoom in the 4:3 aspect ratio mode gets me in tight for most pics. Very few times I need more. Used the video at a softball game, and no blurr. just great picture and sound. The super vivid mode can get some nice pics in the right situation, but most of the time just looks bad. Experiment. I like that I can change the ... aspect ratio to one of 5 different shapes so I don&apos;t have to edit, or crop photos. I just compose with the best size, and shoot.

     <Review>The S95 is a great vacation camera for everyone above the age of 12. Several of the cameras modes require a tripod; but that is no complaint,as this is one of the most versital cameras I have ever used. I own a total of 8 Cannon cameras and lenses but I will be using the S95 for nearly any project from now on. If all your photos are 8X10 or smaller this is your camera. The only caveat I have is the small size of some of the controls, I have large fingers and must look to find some buttons.</Review>

     <Review>This camera is small and light enough to always bring along, and takes high quality pictures... good enough that I won&apos;t feel bad about not bringing the big heavy Canon 60D + lenses on serious hikes or when we&apos;re travelling light. Of course, it isn&apos;t nearly as good as the SLR, but the quality is very good for the size, weight and cost. No regrets on this purchase!</Review>

     <Review>Perfect point-and-shoot with all the manual options you might need. I use this camera for work (location scouting) taking 300-500 photos a day. It&apos;s light weight, fast, easy to use and takes great shots. If you shoot in natural light, it&apos;s great in low light and has a nice little feature called i-contrast for fixing those sharp shadows created on bright days. Downsides: I really don&apos;t like the soft wear you get with the camera. Image browser is super slow. I use canon photo stitch which is average.</Review>

     <Review>I have not owned or used the camera long enough to give a full review. There are plenty out there, and I read many to decide to buy. But I can say that as an Industrial Designer and user of many DSLRs, the s95&apos;s quick manual controls are very nice to use. The lens ring combined with the back panel dial makes for very fast and intuitive adjustment of aperture and shutter speed. The big bright screen reflects those adjustments and then you shoot...it&apos;s sweet. On another note I bought this model over others for its compactness, and I am not disappointed. I&apos;ve owned a series of ELPH Canons, since the first APS Elph in the late &apos;90s. This s95 is about the size of that first ELPH, it fits in its case. I bought a new case from case logic for around $8 that is cordura and has an external pocket th ... at holds an extra battery and sd cards. Anyway, so far I&apos;m very happy with it.

     <Review>Pros: Small, fast, settings, picture quality, flexibility, miniature mode (tilt shift affect)

Cons: pricey, HD video only does 720p at 24 frames

I wanted a camera that would have the same type of settings I have with my T2i and this was it. I love the fact that I can manipulate the settings to what I want. Picture quality is superior than to other Point and shoot cameras. t is handy to have when you don&apos;t feel like lugging around my SLR gear. I would agree that the price is a little high but as stated earlier I like the flexibility of this camera. Its a nice little video camera too. Overall I would recommend this camera to people that have experience in photography and prefer to be in control of their pictures. This may be an intimidating camera to someone that wants just a b ... asic point and shoot.

     <Review>Pros: Taking pictures in low light

Cons: Flash position, memory card is not included

Nice lightweight camera that takes great pictures in low light. Video is nice clear with very good sound. I believe it is the best of the point and shoot cameras on the market today.

It would be nice if the did something about the position of the flash. Pops up in the very spot I hold the camera. Also it would be nice if they included Adobe Photoshop Elements instead of Cannon&apos;s software.</Review>

     <Review>Pros: Small and capable

Cons: May not need my DSLR in all cases ;-)

I have been taking photograph for over 50 years both film and digital and this is by far the best point and shoot camera I have owned. I recently visited San Francisco and carried the Canon S95 camera in my pocket to be able to take pictures without hauling a large DSLR around.

I was amazed at the quality clarity and color reproduced with this camera. This is not a DSLR, but the results are about as close as you can get for a camera with the zoom range of the S95. The low light capability of this camera is the best I have seen with minimal noise in pictures taken ar high ISO settings.

A bonus is that the S95 can record in full HD with stereo sound. The S95 also can be operated in several program ... modes or in aperture, shutter or fully manual modes. The vivid color programmed mode can create some very punchy color pictures. I also find the built in flash small but very capable for the size of the flash.

This camera also has excellent close-up macro mode.

If you like the quality of a DSLR camera and want a backup camera or just don&apos;t want to haul the DLSR around, this is a camera you need to consider.

     <Review>Pros: Ease of use, extremely versatile. Great for the rank amateur or the seasoned professional (like me!)

Cons: A bit pricey, but you get what you pay for.

Took my new Canon S95 that my wife gave me for Valentine&apos;s Day out for a spin to Blue Sushi, Gloria&apos;s, and Pappasito&apos;s restaurants to test its abilities in low light situations, which is the REAL test of a point and shoot&apos;s ability. Almost any camera can shoot something halfway decent in daylight.

My evaluation: Get right to it: THIS camera is the BOMB.COM: 10 megapixel, larger sensor (the secret weapon), capability to shoot RAW+JPEG at the same time, 80-3200 ISO (yes, 3200 that is NOT a custom function), can take High Capacity (HC) HD cards and can be used in full manual mode for photographers who want full creati ... ve control, PLUS Macro ability! Adjustable white balance, including custom white balance control AND (get this) an UNDERWATER white balance setting (assuming you put it in a housing of some sort...lol).

Plus, exposure AND flash compensation, and HD video, too!

There are other &quot;point and shoot&quot; style cameras out there that have many of the same functions, but they aren&apos;t of the same compact design. The others are bulkier, heavier and have the mass of a pint-sized toaster. The S95 is sleek and compact and is about the size of my iPhone...actually a bit shorter and about the same weight.

I LOVE LOVE it!

As guys are wont to do: Let&apos;s put a number on this thing. Scale of 1 to 10, 1 being the low end and 10 being the &quot;buy this thing if you want absolute greatness&quot;....I give this camera an 11 for its ability to do it all in a compact and sleek package. Looking for a great point and shoot? The Canon S95 is the answer.

     <Review>Pros: Lots of features and fast 2.0 lens

Cons: Not much

Lots of flexible features, incl. fast 2.0 lens. Settings take a little time to get used to, but the picture quality, even in low light is the reason I purchased this camera. It meets my expectations. The flash settings are a bit clumsy, but if you know what you are doing or what you want from the picture, you can manually set the flash to meet your needs. If battery life is a problem, as is often stated, I have not run into yet. I have a 16 GB, Class 6 memory card and that is enough to get me through a few days. I do shoot in Raw and jpg for picture quality and 16 GB is enough to get me through 2 days.

If you are an advanced amateur photographer, this is a good second camera behind your DSLR.</Review>

     <Review>This camera is equivalent to G12, the great canon point and shoot, but it&apos;s more practical because of its size. Manual features work perfectly fine for advanced control of shooting, ISO goes up to 3200 and it makes great video. And also it&apos;s pretty and light. I recommend to all users for high quality photo and video in a very compact camera.</Review>

     <Review>Pros: Picture Quality; Features; Compact; Manual Controls; HD video

Cons: Pricey; Annoying pop up flash

Canon S95 has 10 megapixels. IT has excellent image stabilization and loads of useful features. So many in fact, that I have not tried them all out yet. I have used it for low light concert footage shooting HD video. This camera is awesome for low light situations in both photography and cinematography. It is also small enough to fit in your pocket. There are not to many cons to this camera in my opinion. This little baby will serve all my photography needs.</Review>

     <Review>This was a gift for my wife. I wanted to teach her about exposure but I was worried that a DSLR would overwhelm her (and get left at home.) It&apos;s small enough to carry around everywhere and you can still manipulate depth of field and shutter speed. It takes great pictures in any mode. User friendly menus are easy to navigate. Pricey but worth every penny.</Review>

     <Review>Download the CHDK and unlock the potential hidden in this camera (and other much cheaper canon cameras). Shutter speeds of over 2000 seconds, autofocus and zoom during video...rgb histogram, zebra mode for over and or under exposed areas...etc...even in the stock factory mode, the auto shots are great and the scene modes are wonderful. The HDR mode is great for dynamic lighting...shoot in RAW...what isnt to like? Plus this camera slips into a pocket....yes, SLIPS....doesnt need to be stuffed in a pocket. too much adjustability and I finally have a camera I can grow with. The Panasonic LX% is bigger, has an annoying lens cap, and is stuck with the features offered by the factory, nothing to unlock...the video is mono only and the panasonic menus and usability are difficult to use. Go cannon ... for a quality product that can double its features by downloading some files and moving them to your SD card. The LX5 only has the 24mm lens to beat the S95, and the G12 actually has less features and a worse lens (but can still use CHDK). The only real next step up is the sony-NEX, or some other 4/3 camera, but at that point size is still an issue. SImply the best camera for its size. Yeah, Fujifilm has a beast coming out soon, but it costs a bundle. just do it. do it. do it. DO it. Do it. DO IT. do IT. DO it. and buy a second battery.

     <Review>I bought this because I wanted to be able to have controls such as aperture priority, but didn&apos;t want to constantly carry around a DSLR. Obviously, this is not a DSLR replacement, but it has got a great feature set. I especially like the ring around the lens that you can set. That, in conjunction with the click wheel on the back, you can easily change your settings in manual or semi-manual mode. The finish is really sharp - matte black and slightly textured. Nice wide, fast lens, although the nice wide aperture starts going down pretty quickly as you zoom in. The button layout on the top is a little funky compared to other Canon P&amp;S&apos;s I&apos;ve owned, and the pop-up flash takes a little getting used to - had to adjust my natural grip a bit. But, those are minor compared to the featur ... e set and picture quality. Shutter lag is certainly not DSLR-like, but is better than other P&amp;S&apos;s I&apos;ve owned. This is definitely several steps above your typical point-and-shoot. Haven&apos;t tried the video yet, but I&apos;m a little bummed its 30p only. Would love a little 24p action on that. I don&apos;t mind that it&apos;s only 720 and not 1080.

     <Review>I bought this camera for my wife because its easy to use like the other point and shoot cameras. What sets this camera apart is the ability to shoot raw. It has other manual functions that I like as well. You can limit your max ISO setting in order to limit noise in your images. It is a very fast lens at the wide end. The image quality in low light is very good. The only complaint I have is that it does not shoot 1080p video. Canon has been a pioneer integrating video into still cameras and I would have expected for them to have 1080p capabilities in this camera.</Review>

     <Review>I&apos;ve only had this a couple of weeks, but WOW! I&apos;m more of a DSLR guy, but there are so many times I want to have a camera but lugging around the backpack just isn&apos;t worth it. I&apos;ve also found that when I hand someone my Nikon D7000 and ask them to take a picture of me and my lady, it doesn&apos;t come out that well. I had a Canon SD800IS and I liked the results, but I didn&apos;t have enough control. Enter the S95. I bought this after reading a ton of reviews including David Pogue of the NY Times (who wrote a love letter to this camera). It is everything it is supposed to be. Full control, really solid. Not a toy. Not much compromising. And yes, i can shoot RAW! If you aren&apos;t really into photography, ISO, aperture, etc., don&apos;t waste your money. But if you want something to use when you ... r DSLR isn&apos;t with you, and you still want a lot of control over your settings, this is the camera.

     <Review>Pros: Fast/accurate auto-focus, Good Image Quality, Good in Low Light, Large Clear LCD, Small / Compact ... Cons: Poor Flash We have been through several cameras in the last year. We tried a Sony DSLR which had great picture quality and functions but we rarely carried it because it was so big. We tried a Pentax Optio for it&apos;s tough, waterproof design. It was great for outdoor and action shots but indoor pictures had poor quality and so much shutter lag that we could not get a decent picture of our kids. I checked out several compact cameras owned by friends but was unimpressed by the picture quality. We finally decided to suck it up and spend the money on a high end compact. We couldn&apos;t be happier. Picture quality is near that of a our previous DSLR. Shutter lag is minimal and picture qual ... ity is amazing, especially in low light, many times without flash. The only complaint I have about the camera is the pop-up flash which is right where you would normally put your left index finger. It is a suprise when it pops up and sticks because of your finger. The camera is a little awkward to hold but you get used to it. I am planning on buying an aftermarket grip for it to see if that helps but I&apos;ll keep the camera either way. I am a complete novice when it comes to photography mostly taking snapshots. This camera comes at a relatively high price but I have never taken better quality &apos;snapshots&apos;. You really do get what you pay for

     <Review>I am impressed with the quality of the photos, they are extremely vibrant, alive photos. The color and resolution is remarkable. I took mostly indoor photos and compared them with my older PowerShot photos, hands down there is no comparison. The camera is light weight, easy to use, big LCD and has many manual settings. I dropped my old camera and had to buy a new one.</Review>

     <Review>Pros: Easy to use, with many features

Cons: Battery life could be a bit longer, but not that bad

I needed to buy a new camera that was easy enough for my wife to use, but had enough features for me to really explore photography. We didn&apos;t want to get a digital SLR and wanted to focus more on a point-and-shoot camera. This was the one we found.

It has everything that we need and is definitely user friendly for my wife. There are many features for a beginner and advanced photographer. The best part are the manual controls for focus, aperture, shutter speed, etc.

This is worth buying if you want everything in a pocket sized camera. Be prepared to drop some money down, but in the end it&apos;ll be worth it for a camera that can do most everything.</Review>

     <Review>Pros: Great Pictures

Cons: Pricey

This is a great camera not only for its compact size but also for the DSLR like features. Pictures are so perfectly exposed for skin tone and brightness. The fast lens makes the low light pictures much brighter than from other compact cameras. The photo stitching is a cool feature though it requires using a software provided by canon. The different exposure modes, the ease of setting over or under exposures, face detection, etc. make this an excellent camera for advanced photographers who don&apos;t want to lug around a DSLR. HF-DC1 external flash helps to extend the flash range but needs to be used carefully. You won&apos;t regret this purchase - can be carried like a smartphone.</Review>

     <Review>Pros: Great picture; Many button types; Great handling; Full manual; Low Light Photos; Shift tilt; Great Look

Cons: Larger than some

People are calling this the small camera for pros, and they are right. The low light photos are some of the best I&apos;ve ever seen. There is a feature that takes photos at different exposures and combines them for high contrast areas: this only works with a tripod, but it still amazing. The quality is so impressive as is the usability. There are buttons, wheels, and even control on the lens, like an old manual camera. There are even features for fun like smile detector and fish eye. I can&apos;t say enough good about this camera. I take pictures with it everywhere and have loved the results.</Review>

     <Review>Used for taking pictures of the kids/family. We wanted something that had short lag time that was easy to use; kids don&apos;t hold poses and a SLR is too bulky and complicated. It takes time to get used to the flash popping out of the camera body. The flash doesn&apos;t fire every time - I think this is due to rapid picture shooting at close proximity to the subject as the camera automatically adjusts modes. The manual features are great and allow us to knock the rust off college photography classes. Price was a bit high, but it sees nearly daily use so we&apos;ve dealt with it. Overall we love it!</Review>

     <Review>Just got this for my wife and haven&apos;t had a chance to really use much but so far am impressed with the camera. We were looking for a pocket sized point and shoot that would fill in when we didn&apos;t have our DSLR with us and wouldn&apos;t disappoint with photo quality. It seems pretty intuative to use, the screen on the back is excellent and I was able to get some nice low light photos without the flash. The flash can be a little awkward if you are used to steadying the camera holding it with your finger on the top side opposite the shutter button but we haven&apos;t had any issues so far.</Review>

     <Review>I am not a camera expert, but before I made this purchase I spoke to a few friends who do know a lot about cameras, one of whom is a professional photographer. I told them I needed something small, easy, robust and portable that takes great pictures. Independently, all three of them recommended the PowerShot S95.I love my new camera. It&apos;s small enough to fit in a pocket and I can take it anywhere. It&apos;s easy to use and has many options for other settings if one would want to take more advanced photographs. The screen is clear and the case pleasing to hold. I don&apos;t think I could have done better.</Review>

     <Review>I purchased this camera mostly out of a need for convenience. Having lugged heavy photo gear for nearly 30 years now, I finally convinced myself to buy something that would be with me at all times with a minimum of effort. I can already say that I have gotten photos that I would not have due to this, but it&apos;s no SLR, even with its advanced controls. Actually, I&apos;m having the most fun using the cameras video feature, and it&apos;s quite good. However, I can assure you that Canon will design its replacement with focus and zoom functions that operate during filming since unit cannot. Despite that it&apos;s a competent product that&apos;s well made and very handy!</Review>

     <Review>Great pictures, almost DSLr quality. HD Video is also good, the zoom when using the video is ok, but seems to get blurry if you zoom really far. So only good if you dont plan on zooming much, easy to use and setup. Make sure you buy a SDHC Class 10 Card. Also great low light setting for pictures with low light just switch the mode. Only con is the flash is motorized so if you have large hands you might have a hard time holding this with 2 hands.</Review>

     <Review>Pros: Great pictures.

Cons: Short battery life (200 shots).

I love this camera! It does have some flaws and no camera is prefect but here are my pros and cons.

Pros
-Full manual controls plus raw shooting.
-Multitude of shooting modes including an excellent low light mode.
-Multifunction ring for flexibility.

Cons
-Flash is a little underpowered.
-No full 1080p video (it is 720p however).
-Battery life could be longer.

Overall this is a camera I highly recommend to pros or semi pros who want a good point and shoot camera for when they don&apos;t want to carry their Digital SLR.</Review>

     <Review>The PowerShot S95 takes some absolutely stunning images. It is point-and-shoot very user friendliness. I mean the image quality is amazing. Seeing is believing! I have a Canon EOS 7D and carry the Powershot S95 with me when my Canon 7D is not really practical. I shoot alot, so I am now never with out a camera. The High Dynamic Range shooting is awesome. Another cool Canon feature that the PowerShot S95 has is the Optical Image Stabilizer (IS) counteracts camera shake. For a camera of this size to offer RAW and JPEG file formats and a smart high dynamic range function is very cool. If you post edit your pics shot RAW. The battery life isn&apos;t particular generous, but that is what I expected from such a small camera. But don&apos;t let size full you, baby this camera can perform...</Review>

     <Review>I find this to be a great little pocket camera. Good to take out when just going for a walk or short trip instead of my SLR. I have taken a variety of pictures and I am very pleased with the results. Pictures include kids, outdoor foliage, lake and water views, day, night and inbetween. All of them have turned out very good. I have played with the settings features and find they give you whatever control you need to get the result you want. I will say I am not into video and have not used that feature, but will give it a try in the future. The only negative, and one I was aware of before my purchase is the pop up flash. Come on Canon...did anyone in the office try this thing out before putting it on the market. Sure, you can get used to it and avoid the annoyance, but why should we...you h ... ave plenty of other options. Having said that, the flash does work well and produces good results.
