To quite a few of us, an everywhere camera should be small. Hence the very positive response to the Olympus E-P1 and Panasonic GF1. But that&apos;s not small enough for many. I still carry a pocket digital camera for everywhere photography, and the Canon S90&apos;s major competition looks more like the Panasonic LX3 than the E-P1 or GF1. The Canon S90 seems to answer the call quite well, with an all-black body evoking the spirit of the company&apos;s EOS cameras, combined with a relatively pocketable profile.
As I suspected in the Preview, the Canon S90 actually isn&apos;t thicker than the Panasonic LX3, coming in at 1.2 inches thick, compared to the LX3&apos;s 1.5-inch thickness. Panasonic&apos;s own sites say the camera is only 1.09 inches thick, but incredibly that doesn&apos;t include the lens bulge (Thanks to Nima Sa for the correction). Weight is also a little lower on the S90 when you add a card and battery, at 6.95 ounces (197g) compared to the LX3&apos;s 9.1 ounces (257g), quite different from their bare weights (sans battery and card).
The Canon S90&apos;s lens reminds me of one feature that hasn&apos;t come back to the Canon G-series, because its maximum aperture is f/2.0. This changes to f/4.9 as you zoom (a little less than the old G6&apos;s f/2.0-3.0 range). Equivalent to a 28-105mm lens, the lens covers 3.8x range, and can focus as close as two inches.
Canon&apos;s box-and-circle design is popular and often imitated, but this time the ring around the front lens element isn&apos;t just for decoration, it&apos;s a moving Control ring that you can program to perform one of several functions: Focus, ISO, Exposure, White Balance, and Zoom. It&apos;s important to note that there&apos;s no optical viewfinder on the Canon S90, so all adjustments will need to be made via the LCD.
The Canon S90 still uses the ring around the shutter button for zoom control, only this time it&apos;s somewhat recessed into the camera&apos;s top deck. You can also see the Ring Function button that allows quick changes to what the front Control ring does. The pop-up flash is also strangely reminiscent of the Panasonic LX3. It rises and falls under motorized control, rather...

     <Review>Pros: Very good photo quality; Roughly a full stop advantage over typical compact cameras in low light; Fast F2.0-4.9, 28 - 105 mm zoom lens; Optical image stabilization; Ultra high resolution 3-inch LCD with very good outdoor and low light visibility; Full manual controls, with white balance fine-tuning; RAW image format support -- good RAW editor included; Smart Auto mode picks a scene mode for you -- plenty of others to choose from yourself; Quick startup time, good focusing speeds (even in low light); Lots of customizable stuff: control ring and shortcut button, My Menu, custom spot on mode dial, self-timer; Redeye not a problem (much to my surprise); Handy face self-timer feature; Optional underwater case; HDMI output

Cons: Ergonomics are a real mess -- free-wheeling control di ... al makes it way too easy to accidentally adjust important settings, power and ring func buttons are identical and right next to each other, pop-up flash takes up valuable real estate on top of camera, control ring on front of camera a bit small, of limited use; Some shadow noise and NR artifacting in low contrast areas at base ISO -- mild vignetting and corner blurring at times; Sluggish continuous shooting mode; VGA movie mode seems a bit dated -- optical zoom cannot be used while recording; Flash is slow to charge; Zoom controller can be unresponsive -- current zoom setting not shown on LCD; Below average battery life; No optical viewfinder; No memory card included -- can&apos;t access memory card slot while using a tripod

When Canon announced the PowerShot S90, I was pretty excited. Manual controls and a fast lens in an ultra-compact body? Yes, please! My enthusiasm waned quickly once my review unit arrived. Not because of the picture quality or feature set, but because the usability and ergonomics are so poor. It&apos;s like Canon designed the camera without thinking that people&apos;s hands would actually be touching (witness the free scrolling dial, pop-up flash, and identical power/ring func buttons). The PowerShot S90 has impressive photo quality, a fast lens and nice LCD, and lots of manual controls, but using it was just too frustrating for this reviewer. Now, you may disagree with my assessment, and the the only way to find out is to try one yourself

     <Review>The Canon S90 is the latest compact DSLR replacement from Canon - the little brother to the successful Canon G11.

Profits are squeezed to the point of asphyxiation in the compact camera market at the moment; tough economic times mean your typical &apos;point and shoot&apos; compact owner doesn&apos;t feel the urge to upgrade as often as makers would like.

There&apos;s also a bewildering range of new cameras to choose from. And of course, camera phones keep getting better and better.

Hence the rebranding of some compacts as &apos;SLR backups&apos;. The term&apos;s a bit vague, but basically it refers to a compact camera which offers better optical quality and more sophisticated imaging options than your typical point-and-clicker - while still being very compact and easy to carry around.

The kind o ... f compact, in other words, that SLR owners would be happy to take as a backup, or use as their main camera when the SLR is just too big and indiscrete.

The Canon PowerShot S90 certainly falls into this category. It weighs in at a slimline 175g and is only about three inches deep with its 28-105mm lens fully extended.

At the same time, it shoots in RAW as well as JPEG and comes with Canon&apos;s Digital Photo Professional RAW-processing software, just as you get with Canon EOS SLRs. As well as SLRs, the Canon PowerShot S90 has a lot in common with Canon&apos;s flagship compact, the PowerShot G11.

You get the same 10-megapixel sensor, for instance, which as well as offering a very respectful resolution, does a sterling job of keeping digital noise down at higher ISO settings. 

And while the Canon PowerShot S90 only has a 3.8x optical zoom lens compared to the 5x zoom on the PowerShot G11, the difference is not that huge.

     <Review>Canon&apos;s PowerShot S90 compact digital camera is one of the most powerful point-and-shoot models that you can slip into your shirt pocket.

Canon&apos;s PowerShot S90 compact digital camera is one of the most powerful point-and-shoot models that you can slip into your shirt pocket. Much of the S90&apos;s appeal comes from its ability to overcome the shortcomings that often cripple compacts; it performs well in low light, has the option to capture in Raw format and it features an impressive set of controls that allow you to adapt the camera to just about any lighting situation.

The Canon PowerShot S90 compact digital camera can hide beneath a deck of playing cards. Its body measures 100x58.4x30.9mm and weighs 175g. You can slide it anywhere you have a spare pocket. It weighs half as much ... as its big brother, Canon&apos;s PowerShot G11, yet includes the same 10Mp, 1/1.7-inch CCD sensor and Digic 4 image processor. Both cameras feature crystal clear 461,000-dot LCD screens, but the S90&apos;s display is a 3in fixed-back version compared to the 2.8in vari-angle version on the G11.

You may wonder why the Canon PowerShot S90 compact digital camera captures only 10Mp while many of today&apos;s compacts can shoot 12Mp or more. The thinking is that if you put fewer pixels on a larger image sensor, you can better control image noise at higher ISO settings. Canon then developed a high-sensitivity system for its image processor to help optimize the data from low light shots. The result is that you can shoot at ISO 400, 800 and even 1,600 without destroying the image quality. This is a major step forward for a compact camera that sells for around £355.

The lens itself is an important component in this equation. The Canon PowerShot S90 compact digital camera includes a 3.8X optical zoom that has a maximum aperture of f2.0 for the 28mm wide-angle, then adjusts down to f4.9 for the 105mm telephoto. This means that when you shoot at 28mm, you have a very bright f2.0 lens that lets in a lot of light. Even at the 35mm zoom setting, the maximum aperture is f2.5, and at 50mm, a reasonable f3.2. The upshot is that the S90 features a lens that&apos;s extremely well suited for low-light photography.

Unlike many compacts, the Canon PowerShot S90 compact digital camera offers lots of control over the exposure and colour settings. The S90 features a mode dial on top of the camera, a control ring on its front and a control dial on the back. You rotate the top mode dial with your thumb to choose one of these exposure modes: auto, program, shutter priority, aperture priority, manual, low light, scene, movie and custom.

The rotating control ring around the lens on the front of the Canon PowerShot S90 compact digital camera is a true innovation. It&apos;s programmable, giving you the following choices: ISO, exposure compensation, focus, white balance or step zoom. All these functions are handy, but we preferred the step zoom setting allowing us to click-stop between 28, 35, 50, 85 and 105mm lens magnification. It feels very much like using a zoom on a digital SLR. Canon also uses the control ring to let you fine tune Auto White Balance. When you select the AWB function, you can warm up or cool down the color by rotating the ring to the left or right. I absolutely love this feature.

The control dial on the back of the Canon PowerShot S90 compact digital camera isn&apos;t as exciting, although it&apos;s a quick way to fine-tune the settings you&apos;ve already established with the other dials. For example, when you&apos;re in programmed auto exposure, the back control dial can let you adjust exposure compensation. The problem is, there&apos;s no way to disable it. If you&apos;re not careful, you can accidentally brush your thumb against it and change the settings without noticing. Since the control dial is contextual, we recommend you program it to do the least amount of harm. We often shoot in aperture priority mode with the control dial used for changing the aperture settings. That way, if we accidentally brush it, we don&apos;t mess up our exposure,...

Canon&apos;s PowerShot S90 has been replaced by the Canon PowerShot S95. The S90 has the same 10-megapixel sensor as Canon&apos;s larger G11 camera, and shares some of its advanced features, such as optical image stabilization, RAW file support and a wealth of automatic and manual controls and settings. ...</Review>

     <Review>The Canon PowerShot S90 is a superb high-spec compact camera with the emphasis on image quality and controllable versatility. The range of features, build quality and results are excellent, although the fiddly controls and slightly sluggish performance are minor disadvantages. The only real problem is the extremely high price compared to rival models. One of the surprise success stories of last year was the Panasonic Lumix DMC-LX3, a premium compact camera featuring a 1/1.63-inch 10.1-megapixel sensor, a 3.0-inch 460k monitor, and an extremely high quality f/2.0 - f/2.8 wide-zoom lens. Costing a substantial £300 at launch it looked destined for the niche market of photography enthusiasts, but its combination of elegant retro styling, pocket-sized dimensions, high performance and superb ima ... ge quality proved to be a winning combination, and it sold so well that UK stocks of the black version almost sold out. /c6c385|2030_12261-canons903quart.jpg The popularity of such a seemingly exclusive camera must have come as a bit of a revelation to rival Canon, who had previously been the undisputed king of advanced compacts with its long-running and highly successful PowerShot G series. The LX3 put a dent in the sales of the PowerShot G10, so it comes as no big surprise that Canon&apos;s new Autumn line-up includes not just the impressive new PowerShot G11, but also today&apos;s review camera, the PowerShot S90. It&apos;s a welcome return for Canon&apos;s long-dormant S-series of advanced compacts. The S90&apos;s most recent predecessor was the PowerShot S80 launched in 2005. Although I&apos;m sure that Canon would deny any connection, the similarities to the LX3 are hard to ignore. The S90 features a 1/1.7-inch 10.0-megapixel CCD (the same as the G11), a 3.0-inch 460k monitor, and a wide-zoom lens with a maximum aperture of f/2.0. It too has full manual exposure controls, an all-metal body and a very similar pop-up flash. It even has one of its controls on the lens bezel. /acdeb7|c4e6_12261-canons90front.jpg There are a number of significant differences however. For a start the S90 is considerably smaller and lighter than the LX3, measuring 100 x 58.4 x 30.9 mm and tipping the scales at approximately 200g including battery and memory card. The S90&apos;s lens is also quite different, with Canon opting for a 3.8x zoom equivalent to 28-105mm, whereas the LX3 has an extra-wide 2.5x zoom equivalent to 24-60mm. Both cameras have a maximum aperture of f/2.0 at wide angle, but for the S90 this drops to f/4.9 at the telephoto end, compared to the LX3&apos;s much faster f/2.8. The biggest difference however is the price. The S90 is currently selling for a whopping £400, making it one of the most expensive compact cameras on the market.

     <Review>Pros: Great image quality; Packed with features; fast f/2 lenses; Full manual control

I was shopping for a replacement of my old point and shoot camera. I read a lot of reviews and finally decided to get this Canon S90 camera. I needed a low light capabiliyes for indoor and nighttime pictures especially without any flash.This small size camera did an excellent job on those photos with low-light with its fast F/2 lenses. It also have great features and manual operation that most user were looking for. Color integrity is great and the speed of writing the image to the SD card at a very good speed. There is a thumb wheel for user to navigate the menu easily.  Since it is a tiny camera, the size of the battery is small. I can take about 220 shots from a single charge. I would recommend ... to get an extra battery or two on a trip. The only drawback to this camera that it&apos;s aimed at people who want great photos. You cannot take any HD video, just only standard one. In my opinion, This is the best point and shoot you can get in the $300 range.

     <Review>Pros: Good Image Stabilization; Large Clear LCD; Small / Compact; Good Image Quality; Easy To Use; Good in Low Light

Cons: Poor ergonomics

I&apos;ve taken about 500 pictures with my S 90 since receiving it at the end of October. Based on these, I offer the following comments.Positives:It takes great pictures. Color renditions, skin tones, exposure levels are all first rate. Higher ISO noise doesn&apos;t seem to be a problem. Image stabilization works well. The fast F 2.0 lens (at wide open) does wonders for low light no flash photography. For what it&apos;s worth, DxO makes pretty minor changes to S 90 pictures compared to what it does to D 40 pictures. A couple of sample pictures are attached for illustrationThe additional manual control wheels make the S 90 a great learning aid. I ... have the front wheel set for white balance tuning and the back wheel set for exposure control. The short cut button I have set for coarse white balance settings. Because the screen isn&apos;t cluttered with menus, I can see the effect of changes I make to the settings on the view screen before I take the picture. There&apos;s a little lag, maybe a second or so, but that&apos;s tolerable. My increasing knowledge of the effect of these settings has been transferable to my Nikon D 40 and D 90.Ken Rockwell claims the S 90 is the best pocket camera ever. That&apos;s pretty much why I bought it even though I already had a perfectly good SD950. As far as an aspiring amateur (me) can tell, he may well be right as far as the photography goes. Negatives:As has been noted in several user reviews, the placement of the on-off button and the shutter button are awkward, no where near as convenient as my SD950. Also, I can&apos;t tell if my finger tip is on the shutter release by feel like I can on the SD950. The S 90 shutter button is just more plastic under my aging finger tip.Doing a half press on the shutter button to lock exposure and focus is darn difficult. This adds a frustration that takes away from enjoying the camera and photography.The zoom control is jerky and seems to &quot;bounce&quot;. That is, when you give it a nudge, it lags, then goes, then retreats back a little. This makes framing the picture much harder than it needs to be.The pop-up flash is a real pain in the posterior. I&apos;m forever getting my left index finger in front of it. I don&apos;t think it would take much of a blow to break the flash. [$] The S 90 is harder to hang onto than earlier Canon pocket cameras I&apos;ve had. After a couple of very lucky catches, I now make a real habit of putting the wrist strap around my wrist immediately after taking it out of the case.Conclusions:The primary purpose of a camera is to take pictures. The camera should make it easy for the photographer to concentrate on getting the picture right. The quality of its pictures and the benefits of the new ring controls more than makes up for the S 90&apos;s annoyances. However, these annoyances didn&apos;t have to be there. Canon makes other pocket cameras that don&apos;t have screwy flashes, poorly located shutter buttons, or jerky zoom controls.When all is said and done, I&apos;m conflicted about what score to give the camera. Coming from the picture side, a 5 would be justified. From the operating side, it would only rate a 3. So, I&apos;ll chicken out and give it a 4. It&apos;s still the camera I carry around in my shirt pocket most of the time though.Making a long review longer, there&apos;s a review of the S 90 on Amazon that mentions a Kodak semi-hard case. I bought one and it works great. It just does hold the camera, wrist strap, extra battery, and spare SD card. The case provides good protection. I &quot;bounce tested&quot; it with the camera in it on a hardwood floor from about 4 ft. up with no damage.

     <Review>My goal was to stay with a point and shoot but have the ability to move up a notch in quality and the option to do more manually or explore things like depth of field when I was in the situation to do so. I have had it for two months and so far, so good. I like the size of it, the battery lasts a good long time, the colors and clarity are top notch. At first I felt like all images taken on auto were overexposed, but I found I had to get used to the way the camera senses light and just make sure I kept pointing it at varous locations within the image to get the exposure I really wanted before taking the pic. Hopefully that makes sense. It is a little slow, but I knew that when I bought it. If you want to capture a lot of fast motion, the camera will do a great job, but you may get ... frustrated with it at times. My favorite feature is one the scene options where you can select a color in the view finder to keep, and the rest of the image is black and white. For me, this makes my picture taking more fun and my scrapbooks more interesting. I could do this with editing software, but everyone who has done so will tell you it is very time consuming. This is well worth the investment!

     <Review>I use it for snorkeling and surf photography. Amazing how you can use all buttons easily under water. All buttons and dials are available, except rear dial. However, the rear dial&apos;s functionality can be used by simultaneously pressing Fn and the Left or Right arrows. But, I hardly use this. It does its main function - keeping the water and surf sand out of my S90 - best. Only issue I have is that the Shutter Button has a strong spring which gives you no tactile feedback. Pre-focussing is hard to do! So you get a lot of unwanted shots. If you press the button all the way down you get the P&amp;S delay of anywhere between 1/2 and a full second. It&apos;s hard to chase fish with a P&amp;S. (Get a DSLR if you need fast action!) Bring a big memory card and you&apos;ll be amazed what you can d ... o! However, you can&apos;t blame the housing for the short comings of the S90, you should know that. As far as value goes, 9 out of 10. Fun: 10 out of 10.

     <Review>I have used the camera for a couple of recent events: mountain biking, a night time trip around washigton dc, and a family party. the camera met or exceeded my expectations in each case. For mountain biking, fast movement in low light, i had to use higher iso 400+ to keep the shutter above 1/400. The image quality was much less noisy than i expected from a pocket size camera. I used the manual focus feature to reduce the shutter lag. when wandering around DC i forgot a tripod, however i was able to get some great, very sharp shots with long exposure and setting my camera on various surfaces. The photos have very great range, with completely black blacks and very good details on the engravings of bright white monuments. lastly at my family party i was taking shots of people indoors, ... these came out great especially when i used the HF-DC1 flash for a second remote light source. Others have commented on the battery life, to me it is just fine. Not as good as an slr, but considering the screen size and battery size there is only so much you can get. For me the camera size is the best feature and i will take the battery life. It can be maximized if you set the screen to the lowest brightness. Overall, i am very please with this camera, considering it fits in my jeans pocket and has done everything i have wanted it to. A+

     <Review>I bought this as a walk around camera for holidays so I didn&apos;t have to carry my dslr and lenses all day. Having read reviews on well known reviewer&apos;s site I decided to take the plunge and buy this amazing little camera. All in all this is a G11 that will fit in your pocket with the same manual controls and a faster f2.0 lens! The images at iso 80 are virtually noise free which, for a small sensor, is nothing short of amazing. The f2.0 lens drags in light which means I will be using it a lot for gig snaps too. This is definitely a photographers compact. White balance is great on the auto setting but even this is adjustable to your taste for amber/blue and also for magenta /green too. There are two programable dials one of which is around the lens, this i use for exposure compensation- the s ... etting is then displayed on screen as you use it. I do not have time to highlight all the pros in this review but if there was a shortcoming its the ease with which you can accidentally change the iso setting with the second control dial but I can live with that and I&apos;m sure there is a menu setting to turn that off but I haven&apos;t looked in the manual yet, too busy shooting!

     <Review>Before I make specific comments, I must say I just like Canon color, and the S90 doesn&apos;t disappoint. It simply looks rich and lively, unlike my Olympus 550WP which renders lifeless, grey and slightly washed out.I was ready to give up on point and shoot digital photography when I got the Canon. I need a reliable travel camera: small, relatively quick, with manual control. I recently returned from a long trip with the above Olympus which was almost worthless-slow, noisy, unreliable exposures...This was my second try at digital PnS and I was ready to smash the thing-it was so frustrating to use. So far, the Canon has exceed my expectations.So I was careful before purchase. I tried everything! Canon G11-too big and IMHO not worth the extra money for same processor and worse lens than S90. Oly ... mpus PEN-a second choice for me, but of the two I would have wanted the $1000 model. I felt for travel, I didn&apos;t want to drag lenses. The camera&apos;s a bit faster, the micro 3/4 processor is bigger, with the viewfinder and wide angle lens it feels a bit like a Leica-BUT I decided at the money, I&apos;ll just wait and get a Canon 7D and have a real camera. That said, I still like Canon S90 color better.I looked at Lumix GF1 and couldn&apos;t stand it. Very noisy at high ISO. I also don&apos;t like its color or menu set-up.I played with the $2000 Leica as well: this would have been my first choice, but no way do I pay 2K for a single fixed lens. Likewise with every other possibility-I just kept coming back to S90.REVIEW: This is not an SLR. However, the combination of size, color quality, manual set up, and camera intelligence make this unbeatable. In a pinch, AUTO mode gives quite nice results in most situations. However, I notice a tendency to blow out the whites. So I&apos;m preferring P mode underexposing -1/3 to -1 stop with better results.I also manually preset the ISO to the lowest possible for the light condition, altho I&apos;ve used the LOW LIGHT mode for night shots in the Lincoln Tunnel that I&apos;m very happy with. I also shot a series inside the Metropolitan Museum of Art-low light, spot-lit art that came out great.The camera is fast enough for my purposes, with an adequate continuous mode. I&apos;m a street photographer, and I need to capture an instant intuitively, without getting in my head to try to outsmart the camera. So far, the Canon is giving me living pictures I can use. My Olympus was USELESS in this regard.People complain about the back control ring moving too easily and changing settings. (And there are easy on-line mods for this). I, however, have found a left hand cradle grip that leaves the right dials alone. I purchased Richard Franieck custom grip which I&apos;ve yet to use. I wish Canon would have made cleats on both sides of the camera so you can use a real neck strap. That said, I use the nice Lowe Rizzo 30 horizontal case with shoulder strap for pretty quick access to camera.I&apos;m still learning the manual settings: the online Canon forums are useful for setting tips, as well as a couple of G11 books at [...]. For me, I like to keep it simple-Low ISO, keep the aperture in the sweet spot, keep exposure compensation in the back wheel, keep the flash off.I&apos;m still learning about the focus options.For the most part, I&apos;m happy to let the camera do the work. I LOVE THIS CAMERA. I ENJOY learning the camera. For my use, it&apos;s the ONLY camera out there: a great pocketable point and shoot, with manual controls. And at $350, it won&apos;t break the bank. The best performance vs price small point and shoot out there.

     <Review>I love my Canon PowerShot S90 camera! It takes great pictures. It is has so many options, you can take great pictures in a number of ways. It takes beautiful movies too. I especially love the macro feature--you can focus down to 2 inches. The programmable function ring on the front is great for changing focus or zoom. You can shoot RAW, and the software for manipulating RAW files is very good. This camera does it all, and with DSLR quality. You can use it as a pocket camera on total auto for worry-free shots, or you can shoot manually like a pro. It has tons of features, and the battery lasts a long time. The low light capability of this camera is very very good. I am selling lots of my pro gear now because this camera is a lot more fun to use. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND the Canon PowerShot S90 if ... you want to have lots of fun taking great pictures. The only cons to this camera is that you cannot zoom while shooting video and the camera can be hard to hold while shooting.

     <Review>Pros: Great for taking pictures in dimly lighted low light without flash

Cons: Price is high for a point and shoot

Originally purchased an Olympus Model: Tough 6020 Black
SKU: 9765213 for a cruise for the ruggedness and underwater capabilities. The camera was rugged and functioned underwater, but you sacrifice for blurry pictures and choppy video.

Returned it and added an extra $100 for a Canon S90 since it had good reviews and store display worked well. Mainly purchased it because it is easy to use and takes great pictures in low light without flash. I use it in night clubs to take pictures of bands without flash so it&apos; not distracting. Great quality pics. Video is great quality as well. The camera is easy to use and has many great features.

Con - the button ... s are flush so it&apos;s hard to feel them which makes turning on and snapping photos and video hard in darkness. The telescopic button is on the photo button and very small so its difficult to use. the photo button is a half inch too far towards the center of the camera from the edge so you have to be aware of where your trigger finger is. the flash pops up from where your other hands finger naturally wants to rest so be careful.

The camera is great with these few cons aside. Even better if the price dropped by $75 to be more competitive. Watch pricematch with other stores because I save $25 after purchase.

     <Review>My criteria for choosing this camera was the best image quality in a pocket size camera. The size of this camera is about as big as I would want to go for it&apos;s purpose. I believe the image quality is at the top of as good as you can get for a camera of this size. I can&apos;t really compare it to other cameras in this class because this is the first P&amp;S camera i&apos;ve owned in quite a while (not including the iphone). The lens is as fast (f2) and as sharp as they come in a pocket camera. High iso I can&apos;t compare but seems to be about what I&apos;d expect. It may or may not the best in it&apos;s class but when you factor in that it&apos;s about the only one that shoots raw that puts it over the top. It really only has one flaw for me. The little dial on the back right where your thumb always goes ha ... s zero friction. It rotates every time I touch it and I touch it every time I pick up the camera. The kicker is that the dial adjusts exposure in one way or another so I&apos;m always bumping my exposure off. That&apos;s a big problem. A little friction would be nice, and indents would be awesome. I&apos;t might be a deal breaker for me. Actually another slight flaw is the on/off button could be in a better place and should have a little braille to make it findable without looking. My finger should be able to go right to it when pulling it out of my pocket. The rest are hopes and wishes. We&apos;re all looking for the one camera that does everything and that we can hold in our fingertips. And we get a little closer with every new model. This is the best you can get in a camera this size today. Would I like to have cleaner high iso&apos;s? Yes, but not at the expense of loosing megapixels. Would I like more megapixels? Sure, but not if they&apos;re gonna be all noisy in modestly low light. Same with the lens. A bigger zoom ratio would be great but it would sacrifice image quality or size of the camera. A longer lasting battery would be nice too. This one can easily run out in a day of shooting. Again I thing this is the best you can get without sacrificing size. Buy another battery. A pivoting screen (and brighter too) would make the camera far more versatile. And wifi and GPS would be cool too. Just don&apos;t make it any bigger. All in all I think Canon has made the best balance of image quality vs. size to date. Sadly, any day now there will be something better.

     <Review>This is a really nice camera. I wanted something lightweight and small but care about high image quality. So I chose this one. It has exceeded my expectations a bit. It will NOT replace a DSLR but is very good as long you understand its limitations. I really appreciate the control ring (around the lens). You can set the distance to say 28mm or 35mm or the like when in automatic modes. For manual modes (my favorite), it controls the aperture. I have a Canon Rebel XSi DSLR and I did not expect this S90 to beat my DSLR. To my surprise, this S90 is surprisingly competitive with my DSLR. In a way, for dark rooms with lots of underexposure, this S90 has LESS noise than my XSi! Otherwise, the XSi is better. I photograph dim rooms at F/2.0 with ISO 800 often and the results turn out ... nice! Dynamic range is surprisingly good. Downsides I found: The F/2.0 lens is for the wide 28mm setting only. Going to 35mm, you&apos;re at about F2.2 or F/2.5. 50mm is about F/2.8. It then goes downhill to F/4.9 at 105mm which is not that far. Its mainly a wide to medium angle camera. That&apos;s the price for a small camera. Keep this in mind. This camera comes with a wrist strap and I strongly recommend you to use it. Its not that easy to grip. Another downside is strong barrel distortion at 28mm. Canon&apos;s DPP program that comes with the camera will auto-correct RAW images so its not a problem. JPEGS are already auto-corrected out the box. Battery life may be short but I have not used it enough to be able to truly comment on that. The battery is so small, its easy to bring another anyway. Since getting this camera, I sold my 18-55mm lens that came with my XSi. This camera is SMALLER than that 18-55 lens! Getting a wide to medium angle lens that&apos;s fast for my XSi costs more than this camera... so I am taking both my XSi and this S90. The S90 does the wide angle work. It is that good...

     <Review>I never read the reviews in B&amp;H about this camera. But before I bought it I read multiple online reviews by expert reviewers such as those with Imaging Resource. Overall it seems to have been judged a competent picture taker. But most reveiws gave it poor marks for it&apos;s controls. Many e.g. went on at great length about how easy it was to mess up a photo by inadvertently moving the back ring control which has no detents. After using the camera for several days without reading the instruction manual I was ready to return it. Difficult to figure out what setting to use and so-so pictures most of the time. Then I read the manual. This manual is NOT meant for anyone over 40 even with bifocals. It has the smallest print and worst contrast of type to page I have ever seen. But it is ... well written and well organized. It starts out with beginner functions and a beginning photographer can stop there. Then it goes on the intermediate functions, especially the scene modes. An intermediate photographer can easily stop there. Finally there are advanced modes similar to what you see on an entry level DSLR like my Canon T1i. I began to realize that this camera should not be treated like an SLR. It is bought so that you can carry a camera with you, in your pocket, to take pictures at any time. Forget the advanced stuff unless you have a huge amount of time. Take it out, pick the correct intermediate function which takes just a moment, and you are ready to shoot. And in these semiautomatic modes the camera tells you what the controls do, and what they do changes with each setting and suddenly makes perfect sense. Use this as an always with you camera and you will not be disappointed. My last pocket camera was a Canon SD1100. It took a nice snapshot, most times, but not something you would want to enlarge or put on your wall. The s90 can take a picture that is just a small step down from an entry level DSLR! And that in the end is what it&apos;s all about. Finally a pocket camera, ready all the time, affordable, and capable of taking a near professional quality picture. PS, it does have significant shutter lag - that&apos;s just a function of today&apos; level of technology. This is a P&amp;S, not a DSLR.

     <Review>Start with Pros of S90:

Excellent noise control, usable images up to ISO 3200; resolution below iso 1600 comparable to a DSLR.
Compact – will slip into your jean pocket, but don’t sit with it.
Useful front rotating dial, accompanied with the control dial on the back of the camera, allows control of 2 variable factors (ie. F stop &amp; Shutter Speed, or ISO &amp; Scene Selection) easily.
Plenty of manual control, as well as a handful of fully automatic modes and scenery recognition system.
Useful face recognition, great for parties and get togethers, not so good for selective focus.
Plastic LCD front protective glass, less likely to crack, but respectable to scratches.
Highly customizable white balance settings.
Ability to shoot RAW data

Despite been a ver ... y capable camera, the S90 falls short in a few areas:

Incredibly short battery life – less than 180 shots in cold weather. about 200 in normal temp. You’ll want to have at least one backup battery with you.
No HD Movie recording capability – most entry level P&amp;S cameras got HD, why not this one?
No autofocus or zooming during movie recording, basically renders movie recording useless.
Back control dial is easily moved around by accident when holding the camera, resulting in unwanted exposure adjustments.
On/Off button in an awkward position (right in middle of top cover), hard to reach for.
Automatic popup flash will almost always get into your way, based on the way we hold our cameras.
At telephoto end of zoom, aperture drops to F4.9 wide open, and max out at F8, very slow indeed.
Noticeable shutter lag, autofocus may not lock when subject is moving.

It may seem like the cons are overwhelming the pros, but you should not be discouraged, this is by far the best compact point and shoot I have used.

     <Review>I&apos;ve had Canon camera&apos;s my whole life and they&apos;ve always taken amazing pictures. I&apos;ve only had this one a few weeks, but have taken it to a BBQ and around Manhattan taking photos. So far, this camera has taken some amazing shots that even surprised me. The colors were excellent and the shots crisp. I absolutely love that you can zoom in further than the 3.8x that it says you can and still get fairly spectacular shots. The menus are easy to use and intuitive. For some reason, I keep missing the click button, but I think I just have to get used to my new camera. I haven&apos;t had a chance to use the manual functions yet, so I cannot speak to those. All in all, a great camera at a decent price.</Review>

     <Review>Pros: Easy to use, Great pictures, Compact size

Cons: Price kind of steep

I&apos;ve owned many small digital cameras, the most recent being a Canon SD990. Saw the Canon S90 in store and thought to give it a try. Wow, what an awesome digital camera. It&apos;s compact, svelte body is a huge plus...but, the best feature is the excellent pictures this camera produces - fine details and great colors. Canon got it right with this S90! The S90 has an f/2.0 lens (only other compact camera that I know has it is the Panasonic LX3 which is $500) that allows for great indoor shots without the use of a flash. The unique rotating dial around the front lens allows for quick changes of certain functions and the camera features a low-light mode. I am very happy with the S90 and can highly recommend it. ... .. though the $429 price is a little steep.

     <Review>Pros: f2.0 lens, large CCD sensor, large LCD, wide angle lens, control ring, night shots

Cons: No HD video, a little large

I started off with an SD960is, but was really disappointed with the image quality, especially on darker scenes. It was compact, shot HD video, and would probably suit 9 of 10 people perfectly, but I&apos;m too much of an IQ snob and night shot person to live with it.

So, I traded up to the S90 and couldn&apos;t be happier. The f2.0 lens is amazing, I don&apos;t believe there there are any other P&amp;S&apos;s out there with anything better then a 2.8. Combine the fast lens with the 1/1.7&quot; CCD (not CMOS) sensor and you get amazing night pictures, and fantastic quality all around. Even though it&apos;s &quot;only&quot; 10MP, the IQ far surpasses that of the 12MP SD960is. Fully manual ... mode is great and intuitive, the control ring allows quick adjustments of anything you need (ISO, shutter speed, focus, zoom, white balance, etc). The camera also powers up in less then a second, great for saving battery life but not missing that great shot. Shutter response is good for a P&amp;S, but obviously not instantaneous like a DSLR.

As far as I am concerned, I don&apos;t think you can get a better P&amp;S if you are anything more then a casual photographer. Most reviews you will find on the web and in magazines agree. My only gripes are lack of HD video, and it&apos;s just a tad on the large side because of the lens/control ring. Most photography purists are on board with lack of HD video, but I think it&apos;s a simple feature that would have been nice to have. The size really isn&apos;t an issue, still small enough to fit in a pocket, but it&apos;s just a hair too large to fit in the &quot;small&quot; size cases so you will have to look at something in the medium range.

Bottom line: Buy an S90 and you will never look back.

     <Review>Use the product for travel photography, did not want to lug my Canon D50. Great pictures, ability to control exposure and different modes are a big plus. Fits in your pocket. Did not have a problem with battery life as other people have reported, but used it for a lot of daylight photography without flash. The only downside is that the zoom only goes to about 105mm, there were some situations where I wish I had more zoom. However, if I was going to take my DSLR with me, I made the decision to only take one lens to cut down on bulk and weight. That was my 28-105mm, so I can&apos;t say I would have done any better. The trade off is for a faster lens with great image quality at pretty much all focal lengths.</Review>

     <Review>Pros: Packed with features; Reasonably priced; Easy to use; Great image quality

Cons: Flash gets stuck easily if pressed on

I recently got married and wanted to buy the best compact digital camera I could afford -- we needed one for the honeymoon, knew we&apos;d be adopting a puppy when we got back, and also wanted one that would take great photos when we start having children in a couple of years.

After spending hours scouring the Internet for both professional and &apos;end user&apos; reviews, I chose the Canon s90.

I&apos;m definitely an amateur photographer, so I love the fact that the &quot;Auto&quot; setting on this camera works so well.  However, it&apos;s easy to learn to use the other modes, turn the flash off and on, etc., and make other custom adjustments if you need to do so.  The use ... r manual is detailed yet easy to understand even for a &apos;newbie&apos;.

This camera is absolutely packed with features.  Menus are easy to navigate; settings such as the screen brightness, shutter sound, startup sound and image, navigation click sound, and volume for all of the above sounds, as well as for the video playback, can all easily be customized.  You can even do some basic photo editing of images with the camera, such as applying sepia, B&amp;W and other effects, adjusting color, etc..  As you shoot, it will also display the number of pictures for which your card has room remaining, given the quality you&apos;re currently using (fine or normal).

Its face detection and auto focus works extremely well.  The only problem is with very fast-moving subjects, but that&apos;s going to be a problem for any camera in this class.

My family has owned a number of Nikon and Sony digital cameras in the $250-$350 range in the past and the s90 takes far better pictures than any of them, especially in low light.  Downloading to my PC is quick and easy with the included software.

The s90 also shoots pretty good video, though it&apos;s not high-def.  You can zoom in and out while shooting, and the sound is clear.  With a 2 GB card, you can shoot about 24 minutes of video, while an 8 GB card will hold an hour and a half.  One warning about shooting video -- it consumes both the battery and the storage space on the card rapidly.  For example, with my 4 GB card, I&apos;d been shooting for a few days; I had space for about 1000 photos left, and then shot about 15 or 20 minutes of video, and saw that my estimate of photos remaining had dropped to just 80 or so.  The battery, which had been at about 3/4 charge, was getting low as well.  (Canon estimates the battery should last through 225 photos, but doesn&apos;t give an estimate for video).

I&apos;ve had the camera for a couple of months now and the only issue I&apos;ve had (and it&apos;s a common one) is getting the &quot;wrong flash position&quot; error due to having accidentally pressed on the pop-up flash when it was shooting.  This can sometimes be corrected by restarting; one time, the error persisted and I found that by gently pulling up on the flash with my fingernail, it was fixed.

All in all, this is a great camera for those who aren&apos;t looking for a cheap camera, but also can&apos;t afford (or don&apos;t want to lug around) an SLR.  The features and image quality can&apos;t be beat for the price.

     <Review>i bought this camera for almost one month. Actually i have already had a professional digital camera ,but it&apos;s too heavy. so i bought this one again. it&apos;s actually beyond my expectation. i love it very much. it&apos;s not as heavy as the professional one,so that i just put it in my purse when i go everywhere. so i can make a wonderful picture whenever i want. it can make the picture in very good quality which is almost the same to those made by professional camera, especially the color is so good. and it&apos;s very convinient because it can choose the best model automatically. it also has the function of making movie. i love it. i uses it for everyday when i go to musemums , beaches, central park and everywhere. Of course it also has the thins that is not so great. i don&apos;t like the battery very muc ... h. but that maybe because i take too many pictures at one time. if you don&apos;t make more than 300 pictures in three hours , i think it doesn&apos;t matter. i love my camera, Canon s90 . i love its color, it&apos;s so cool, i love the pictures it makes, i love the case, and almost everything about it.

     <Review>Pros: Good in Low Light; Nice features

Cons: Limited Zoom; Questionable design

This camera was bought as a large step up from an ancient point and shoot digital, and as a lighter camera to carry around when my SLR is just too much. Bought the S90 based on the awesome f/2.0 and full manual capabilities in a small package. LOVE it for lower light conditions, special shooting modes, full manual made pretty easy with limited buttons. Took over 1000 pics with a quick learning curve and few problems.
The problems: I miss being able to go above f/8 for shallow depth of field. Have to suck it up- it&apos;s a point and shoot. Occasionally find the auto focus to be less than...working. Optical zoom is limited, and digital zoom is frankly horrible. But the biggest complaint- the pop-u ... p flash is right under where your left index finger wants to be to hold the camera steady. If you try to turn on the flash (or if the camera decides to in Auto) and your finger is on, it will get jammed and you have to reset the camera. After 3 months and maybe 10-12 times of this happening, it got permanently jammed. Will still work if I lift with my fingernail, but frustrating. No need for it to have been pop-up when it could have been open on the front of the camera.
Overall great pics, and happy with the money I spent...assuming Canon will fix the flash for me.

     <Review>Pros: Well-designed interface; Good Image Quality; Compact; Lots of features; Good in Low Light

Cons: Limited Zoom; Easy to drop; Expensive

There are an abundance of insightful reviews about this camera out there to be found, but from my first few weeks of use, if you know what you&apos;re getting, you&apos;re bound to be pleased. It&apos;s not a super-zoom, and it&apos;s not quite an ultraportable, and it&apos;s a little too expensive to justify keeping it on Auto all the time. By my estimation, it&apos;s a *very* capable, highly customizable, compact point-and-shoot designed with image quality as a first priority.

Compact though it may be, it doesn&apos;t lend itself well to one-handed operation: I haven&apos;t dropped it yet, but I&apos;ve already been saved by my wrist strap a few times. For what it&apos;s worth, ... the build quality seems good, though I&apos;m not about to try my luck against gravity and pavement.

Though I miss a well-defined grip, the intuitive Control Ring on the front gives you a reason to bother having two hands on the camera -- it lets you assign it to your setting of choice (ISO, exposure level, manual focus distance, and so forth). It&apos;s definitely a triumph of design interface, and makes the camera&apos;s potency a lot more accessible to those who aren&apos;t keen on sifting through menus before every shot.

As a small sticking point, you can&apos;t double-assign the same setting to both the control ring and the menu wheel on the back, or turn one or the other off altogether. I get why, but it would be nice to totally idiot-proof my setup, especially since the menu wheel is pretty easy to jostle. Generally speaking, though, the Control Ring is far more blessing than burden.

The camera&apos;s low-light shooting prowess is a big selling point, and you needn&apos;t use the Low Light setting on the camera to take advantage of it: the lens has a maximum aperture of f/2.0, the image processor keeps most grain away even up to ISO 800, and the image stabilization is decent. Certainly, if you&apos;re just after a quick snapshot of where you were, rather than something you might wind up printing, you&apos;re in fantastic shape.

The S90 offers a large range of manual control, though its lens isn&apos;t quite magic enough to make Full Manual a worthwhile default -- I use it on Program Mode, and hop to Shutter Priority when a situation calls for it. If anyone can offer a practical use for Aperture Priority mode, I&apos;d sincerely like to hear it.

Its video is pretty unremarkable, but that&apos;s not an issue for me -- I feel like the emphasis was clearly on taking good pictures, period. On the flipside, if you&apos;re a doofus like me who loves taking extreme close-ups of just about anything, the S90 has a very strong macro mode.

Phew. Hope this all helps!

     <Review>I was looking for a good quality P/S to take with me on family outings, or just to always have with me. I am currently shooting the Canon 5dmk2 but that is not a setup that you want to take everywhere you go. I wanted a camera that had RAW capture and good quality images. The S90 is not going to have DR or quality of a DSLR but it is very appropriate for everyday shots that you don&apos;t want to miss. It is 110% better than the camera you don&apos;t have with you because it was too cumbersome to carry!! It is very compact, which was the whole point for me. I wanted a camera to go in my purse or pocket. If you get bigger than this you start to defeat the purpose of ultra portability. Some think that the S90 is fumbly without the after market grip. I personally don&apos;t have an issue with it but I do h ... ave small hands. I will echo the fact that the dial on the back is all too easy to hit and change settings by mistake. Probably my only real complaint. I would definitely recommend the S90.

     <Review>I bought this camera to use as a point and shoot underwater in connection with Canon&apos;s DC-35 underwater camera housing. There are a lot of camera models out there that have housings to go with them, but most of the cameras do not have both compact size and manual controls. That and I have had good experience with Canon&apos;s digital point-and-shoot cameras. 

I used it mostly on automatic above water and it handled low light, sunsets, nature, scenes and portrait pictures well. Underwater I used it exclusively on manual and adjusted the aperture, shutter speed, and ISO as well as used the automatic white balance for underwater. Most of the closeups were right on and well lit, but most subjects farther away than 2 feet were bluish - even with the flash and diffuser.

I only used vid ... eo rarely but it seemed to capture video fine. 

Overall I feel that I got the best, smallest, lightest, manually-controlled camera on the market at the time and I would do it again.

     <Review>While by no means a professional photographer, I studied photojournalism and studio photography in college. I understand and use most of the capabilities of the cameras that I own. I had a Panasonic DMC-FZ8 that I unfortunately damaged when I dropped it. I was quite happy with the quality of the images of that camera, but wanted a smaller point and shoot that I could take anywhere, especially to take pictures of my one-year-old. There are numerous amazing things about this camera. I have only had it for a few days, but the F2 lens is remarkable. I am usually expecting the flash to go off, and often it doesn&apos;t and the image is still amazing even in low light. The size is great, and the amount of control that I have over the settings are exactly what I was looking for. My only complain ... t so far is that the flash pops up automatically and I am not used to where to put my hands, so it often bumps my fingers. The camera is quite small, so there aren&apos;t many places to hold it. Once I get used to that, I am sure it won&apos;t be a problem. The camera is quite solid and feels like a real camera in a small size. The zoom is limited, but the digital zoom is passable. One of the coolest aspects is that you can turn the ring on the front of the lens and change quickly from 28 - 35 - 50 - 85 - 105. Overall I think this camera is fantastic. Whether you have a clunky SLR and want a backup or just want a small camera that you can really control all the settings and takes AMAZING pictures, this is for you. I am thinking at some point I will get my dream clunky high-powered SLR, but I might find that I don&apos;t need it after having this. I almost didn&apos;t get this because it does not have HD, but that would have been a huge mistake. I am a believer in not expecting one reasonably-priced tool to do everything. The picture quality is fantastic. Also, the video DOES zoom while filming. That is a big plus that my Panasonic didn&apos;t do, and it would drive me crazy.

     <Review>I purchased this to replace to my faithful G7. I use this camera for travel when the 50D stays home and for get-togethers with friends and family. The picture quality from the S90 is amazing for such a small camera and much better than the G7, which I also love. Having RAW capability is all the more valuable when you capture that perfect travel shot you wouldn&apos;t want to lose. Colors are vibrant and distortion is low execpt for the edges at the widest angles. I&apos;ve found fringing also to be very good. ISO performance is good up through ISO 400 where the G7 was much degraded by ISO200. I have captured shots in an almost totally dark room at ISO 3200 with acceptable results for what it is - meaning that there is quite a bit of color noise. The S90 handles ok but it is so small that kee ... ping a grip can be difficult. I added a finger grip that solved this problem. As others have said, the pop-up flash can dislodge your left hand but I normally control the flash manually, so it doesn&apos;t surprise anyone. Also, the ring on the back is easily moved by accident, changing your exposure so I make confirming the exposure bias on the monitor a matter of habit. The control ring around the lens is nothing short of genius and now couldn&apos;t live without it. Although I&apos;ve heard that battery life wasn&apos;t that good, I&apos;ve found it to be quite acceptable and only once had to change batteries during one day of shooting. This camera will go everywhere I go.

     <Review>Pros: Large Clear LCD; Nice Body Color; Good in Low Light; Small / Compact; Good Image Stabilization; Great Zoom; Good Image Quality; Short Lag Time; Easy To Use

Husband and wife purchased this product for Valentine&apos;s Day. Wife is accomplished photographer, husband a casual phototographer.

This is a perfect camera to fit into a bag or a pocket and get excellent photos. The camera has adjustments that work well under unusual conditions. Camera body is very nice also.

Gary at Adorama answered all our questions and assisted us with all the required options. Purchased wonderful camera bag, fast memory card, and extended warranty.

Such a wonderful experience my husband sent his brother and our sister-in law to Adorama to see Gary and purchase the same items the fo ... llowing week.

Used this at Sesame Street live and took great pictures of all the characters.

     <Review>Excellent start up time and shot to shot recycle time - even with flash. Nearly all the options an advanced photographer could ask for while giving the beginner a great unit to grow into. Out of the box it&apos;s Auto-Aim-Shoot. I like the ring control around the lens for SLR-like zoom control. Although I&apos;m a Nikon SLR user, no one beats Canon in this format. If you want great picture quality and amazing low light capability (simple amazing for this lens) just buy this camera. No HD movies but still very very good quality. Flash pop-up is a bit inconvenient but helps (a little) with red eye. Easy to have your finger over it as it tries to deploy. Overall a great value in a powerful package.</Review>

     <Review>Excellent pocket camera if you want control. Amazing in low light. Expensive. Most drawbacks are due to Canon trying to stuff everything we want into a smallish package. You pay for available light abilities and relatively wide angle lens. If you do not want lots of control over the image, there are better choices for you money that are smaller. Pros: good controls, low light, wide angle lens with good zoom range, good controls, excellent finish. Cons: cost, flash pops up into my finger, no rangefinder (shortened battery life), exp compensation adjustment easy to bump, smallest aperture limited to 8</Review>

     <Review>I bought the S90 to have a camera that is easy to carry at all occasions and that offers not only powerful automatic photography but also enables to operate in full manual mode. The front ring (exactly feeling like a classic aperture ring) can be used to adjust aperture, but can also switched to set time, white balance or ISO-settings. Absolutely amazing. The fast (1:2) lens together with the electronic stabilizer enables available light photography on a new level (for such a small camera!). The one and only thing missing is a system flash interface. Taken together: Exactly what I was looking for, best in class.</Review>

     <Review>Pros: Low light quality - available workable accessories - function ring on lens barrel.

Cons: Nothing negative about it.

Purchased this camera for its low light ability and the function ring on the lens barrel. It clips to my belt loop and I can comfortability take it anywhere. Low light pics are sharp and detailed. The aftermarket accessories are workable and greatly add to the compact digital. The real test was use in extremely foggy conditions on a river in drizzling rain. Pics of tow boats slipping away in the fog were detailed and color surprising good despite thick fog. Very realistic imaging. Moisture and drizzle did not affect the camera or its operation. Dried it off and kept on snapping shots. The camera fulfills every expectation. This camera was not purchased for ... video so that operation isn&apos;t important to me.

     <Review>I&apos;ve been using this for about a week now and I am very pleased. Having used a Canon G10 extensively, I found that camera too big still in many situations when I left it behind due to its bulk. The S90 offers practically the same levels of quick response and solid image quality in a slim package that easily fits in a jeans pocket. It should be noted that the lens does not perform quite as well as that of the G10 - notably some corner softness and increased distortion is evident upon close examination. However given the one stop faster aperture (f/2.0) and extremely compact size, this is easily forgivable. The new sensor delivers excellent colours at high ISO values and the in-camera noise reduction does a very good job. If you shoot JPEG or at least use Canon&apos;s DPP raw conversion softwar ... e, distortion will be automatically corrected (though not 100%). However if you plan on using a third party raw converter, you may want to look into PTLens which can fully correct the images. Sometimes I wish Canon had found a way to provide a detachable fixed viewfinder. The rear dial does not click and the on/off button cannot be operated with your right hand while holding the camera. I would have also preferred to manually raise and close the flash. These are small niggles however. All in all, this is a well put together compact which any power user will be perfectly comfortable shooting with. No more excuses to leave home without a camera, and you won&apos;t feel shortchanged that you didn&apos;t bring the DSLR!

     <Review>I carry this camera w/ me everywhere that I go. The lightweight and compact form factor make it much more appealing than my Tenba rolling case and 50d. The quality of the shots in low light is amazing! I&apos;ve taken photos in dark rooms w/ only the light of a tv/computer monitor and the camera produced excellent quality shots with minimal graininess. I really chose this over the G11/10 because of the form factor and the ease of changing functions (there aren&apos;t knobs stacked everywhere on the body). Pros: best quality photos for form and size. Ease of use and great quality photos at high iso w/ little or no light. Cons: Video is still only VGA. Conclusion: This is a great all around camera for the non pro and pro alike. I actually have used it for magazine editorial photos and found no iss ... ue w/ photo quality.

     <Review>This camera replaced my aging Canon Digital Elph. Its slightly larger but can still fit (tightly) into my front jeans pocket. I wanted to get as close as I could to a DSLR without the bulk and this camera acheives it. I use this camera to shoot pictures of my kids and landscapes. The larger CCD and F/2.0 lens are the big draws. The ring controls on front and back, combined with the programmible button on back mean that I rarely dive into the menus. The camera remembers my preferences for each mode and lets me store one custom mode. Biggest con is speed and screen blanking. My older SD300 was faster (3Mpix) even though I only shoot at 4Mpix now. Most significantly, the screen blanks during the shot AND file transfer. For continuous shots or bracketed shots this means you have no i ... dea what&apos;s going on.

     <Review>Pros: F20 lens; Aperture ring

Cons: Washed out LCD; Inaccurate ISO ratings

1. Washed out LCD screen color
2. ISO rating one stop under listing
3. Overly contrasty images from RAW and JPG
4. Slippery surface

The S90&apos;s LCD screen is very washed out making it difficult to evaluate one&apos;s exposure. Skin tones are particularly washed out.

ISO rating is appears to be incorrect. The &quot;Sunny 16 rule&quot; does not work with the displayed ISO in Manual. Example: Metering off a grey card in direct mid-day sun should yield an exposure of ISO 80 with f5.6 and 1/640s. Instead the proper settings to reflect accurate exposure at ISO 80 are f5.6 and 1/320s. ISO set at 80 performs as if it were ISO 40. In fact, testing ISO 200, 400 and 800 all revealed that their tr ... ue sensitivities appear to be ISO 100, 200, and 400. Hence, noise levels &apos;appear&apos; lower at ISO 800 than normal for a PowerShot camera, when in reality, the noise levels should be compared to ISO 400 as this is the true sensitivity.

Images appear artificially contrasty in RAW or JPG Fine. Shadows are nearly black with no detail without pumping them up in RAW images using Canon&apos;s own DPP software. Images shot with prior Canon models had smoother detail in the shadows.

The S90 has a beautiful casing. It would benefit from some texturing. The surface is incredibly smooth and slippery making it challenging to hold.

Overall, this platform has great potential. Love the &apos;aperture ring&apos; and compact size. Would like to see the return of SuperFIne compression in Canon&apos;s PowerShot lineup. Fine compression simply has too many artifacts especially evident in flesh colors, and large areas of the same color. Very noticeable when viewed at 100%. f2.0 lens a huge plus. Thank you Canon for paying very good detail to the lens!

     <Review>Pros: Picture quality, low-light capabilities, manual controls, RAW, control ring/dial

Cons: Average battery life, no HD video (if it matters to you)

I decided to purchase a new pocket camera to take on a trip to Disney World. I needed low light capabilities for indoor and nighttime pictures without a flash and a wide angle lens. I purchased two cameras and compared them for several days prior to the trip. The two cameras were the Sony WX1/B and the Canon S90. Each has its advantages and disadvantages. The Sony is smaller, has better battery life, and does HD video. It has some unique and interesting modes including the rapid 10 shot and slick panoramic modes. The Canon has faster glass (f/2.0), full manual controls, a unique flexible control ring/dial, RAW capability, great ... build quality/feel and very low noise levels for a pocket camera. Its battery charger requires only two hours. The downsides of the Sony include a slow included battery charger (6 hours but you can buy a faster charger for $50), cheaper build quality/feel, and really poor auto white balance requiring constant manual tweaking. The contrast and exposure levels on the Sony images were also inconsistent and almost always worse than those on the Canon requiring a trip to Photoshop for corrections. The Sony also had higher noise levels at all ISO values than the Canon. The downsides of the Canon are it&apos;s larger size (but still pocketable), the lack of HD video, worse battery life (buy a second battery) and its narrower zoom range (28-105 mm equivalent vs. the Sony&apos;s 25-120 mm). The bottom line was that I was getting a camera mainly for pictures and while I will miss the HD video and some of the Sony&apos;s special modes, the picture quality of the Canon was superior to the Sony. Its low light capabilities were also greater with the faster lens, its own lower resolution high sensitivity mode, and lower noise levels. I returned the Sony and kept the Canon. I took about 700 pictures and shot about 50 videos with the Canon on my trip and feel that I clearly made the right choice. While the Sony was good, the Canon was the winner for me. Even in auto mode, t ...

     <Review>Pros: Low noise, high quality 1/1.7&quot; sensor, easy manual adjustments on two dials, and all in a compact form factor

Cons: For its class nothing

This camera does exactly what is advertises to do. It takes great pictures and is capable of taking high quality low light pictures. I have taken several pictures in low light environments at varying ISO levels. The pictures come out wonderfully with little noise. There is noise, but I feel the amount is more than acceptable. By using the front dial as well as the wheel you can change several manual adjustments on the camera quickly and easily. One earlier review docked this camera down for having so many adjustments and &quot;would take time to learn&quot;, but if you&apos;re complaining about it why did you get it. It&apos;s a advanced compact not a po ... int and shoot. The thumb dial can be annoying sometimes when you hit it and change a setting or move to another picture. I think it will just take some time getting used to. This camera does not have HD video, but it is not meant to be a video camera. It takes videos well at its standard 640x480 resolution. at 30fps. It is expensive, but for the feature set you essentially are getting a entry level SLR in your pocket. On a feature basis it is very comparable to the G11 and actually beats it by have a fast f/2.0 lens. If you want to take great pictures in a variety of environments I recommend taking a look at this camera.

     <Review>My first underwater pictures turned out really great on my latest trip to Cozumel. I found that the flash was nearly useless and used the battery fast, making it best to take pictures when sunlight penetrates the surface. Deeper than 6m (or murky water) would require a separate strobe. Also, setting the review display on hold emptied the battery quickly, but after turning this off, I could snorkel for four hours. I&apos;m used to using SLRS so it&apos;s annoying how long it takes from you press the shutter until the picture is taken. I also found that the camera automatically adjusts the shutter speed even if it&apos;s on shutter speed priority (could be that there&apos;s a way to fix this that I don&apos;t know), and this gave many blurry photos, but with an OK exposure. But the bottom line is, this camera ho ... using opened up a new world to me.

     <Review>The camera is nice and compact - definitely small enough to slip into a pocket or purse. It operates quickly and takes good shots. The S9 is also one of the cheaper, high quality ultra-compact cameras that you&apos;ll find. Unfortunately, with the money that you save, I would recommend that you get a spare battery since the battery life of the camera is not amazing. It would probably make it through a weekend vacation, but that&apos;s about it.

The camera is definitely not meant for an advanced shooter, or someone who wants to tweak settings until they get just the right shot. There are no manual exposure controls, so you&apos;re stuck with adjusting white balance, sensitivity (ISO), exposure compensation, or using the built in scene modes. However, I would still recommend the S9 for someone ... looking for an ultra-compact camera with some style and an affordable price. The camera is good for snapshots, and the one touch button to access Nikon&apos;s portrait mode with Face Priority AF provides quick access to the optimal settings to capture your friends having a great time.

Pros

Good image quality

Nice size and attractive styling

Good price for an ultra-compact

Cons

Disappointing battery life

Red tones challenged the camera

Loud zoom motor

     <Review>Pros: Great image quality; Easy to use

I got this camera about a year ago. I was looking for a camera that was more than a point and shot but not all the way up there with the DSLRs. I got just what I was looking for! This camera takes great pictures in low-light settings the quality is great! I also love the look of the camera. However one thing that I do not love about the camera is its size. However, it is still small enough to fit in my purse and its not too heavy. One other thing that is a little wierd about the camera is the flash that pops up. For people who have not used this camera before get a little confused when the flash pops up from the top of the camera. I have also noticed that when other people take pictures with my camera, they tend to have a hard time pushing the ... botton all the way to take a picture. Howver, I have never had any problems with that. The functions are easy to use and it takes great videos as well. Overall I love this camera and Canon in general.

     <Review>I am going to be snorkeling for 10 days and was looking for the best water shooting strategy. I don;t plan on doing much water shooting after this, so I was hesitant to buy a housing. So instead I bought a Canon D20 which can be submerged to 30ft. However when I tested in a pool the pictures were simply not sharp. So I sent it back and bought the housing for my Canon S90. The difference is night and day. I was afraid the glass on the housing would impact the pictures. While I am sure it does have some impact on quality -- I just have not blown the images up enough to check. But it is so obviously better than the D20.The controls work very easily -- the only issue, mentioned by others -- is that you can turn the dials. Therefore you need to shoot in program mode -- that will giv ... e you control of everything from the buttons on the casing.All and all, really worth the price --

     <Review>This is a great camera but does require a little manual input. So if you want a very basic point &amp; shoot, I would not recommend it. But if you are willing to put in just a couple of hours to play and experiment with, it&apos;s a terrific camera. Very fun and takes great photos. I needed a camera that excelled in low-light and very bright conditions and this one definitely does the trick. I also like that it&apos;s small but the screen is big. My only complaint is that the flash is located in a bad place. It pops up and we always put our fingers on it, missing the first chance for a photo. Also the shutter button on the top is also located in a bit of an odd location. I&apos;m sure we&apos;ll get used to both though so it&apos;s really only inconvenient when someone else takes a photo with our camera. I&apos;d still ... buy the same camera though again as the photos are beautiful and it&apos;s fun!

     <Review>We bought this case to take pictures at Niagara Falls, and we&apos;re very glad we had it during our ferry ride and walk along the bottom of the falls. The case itself is sturdy, easy to use, and the picture quality is still excellent. The only negative is that you can&apos;t adjust the camera settings once it&apos;s put in the case. Otherwise, we&apos;re very pleased with it and figure it was a great investment that opens up all kinds of opportunities for taking photos.</Review>

     <Review>Pros: Easy to use

Cons: Battery doesn&apos;t last as long as other digital cameras I&apos;ve had

I did a lot of researching before purchasing this camera. I consulted friends and beginner professional photographers. I read reviews for hours, asked the Best Buy sales clerks and in the end this was my first choice.

After owning Kodak Easyshare cameras for the past 5 years, this camera is a breath of fresh air. It is compact enough to fit in your pocket or purse. It has automatic settings that choose the best scene for the picture you are taking. It is easy to use and takes nice, clear pictures.

If you want to get artistic, you can play around with the manual settings as well.

Several people complained about the position of the flash. I have not experiences any issues ... with this. You just have to adjust where you place your left index finger. You get used to it right away. Also, some have complained about the grip of the camera. I also have not experienced any issues with this.

So far I love this camera and look forward to playing around with it more to experiment with different types of shots.

     <Review>Bot this camera to replace my G9 that had &quot;no power&quot; issues for a second time in a year and was sick of repairing it. Was worried that the small size and my generally shaky hands would overpower the IS, not true. Was also worried about the control wheel on the back and have had zero issues accidentally bumping it. Picture quality is excellent, fits in the pocket great and is an excellent camera that hides in an unassuming shell. Also, bot this for $340 on closeout, wouldn&apos;t have held out for the S95, just not enough amazing features.</Review>

     <Review>I like the size-it will fit in my pocket. Like the 2 rings for adjusting in manual; the ring around the function key does move a little too easily as suggested in the reviews. I&apos;ve read the manual twice so far, but when it gets to taking pics using the different functions, I&apos;m still getting lost. I&apos;ve been playing with all the knobs and battery seems to wear down quickly. I was looking for a small camera to take on vacation and this fits the bill. Also wanted something a little more fancy that would allow me more creativity. Bought a book on Understanding Exposure and it really helped me to better understand the basic camera functions (f stops; shutter speed; ISO). Only now I&apos;m wishing I bought a DSLR with even greater range. It is a real trade-off between size and options. Maybe I ... &apos;ll have to buy the DLSR when I get this one mastered....

     <Review>Amazing picture quality and manual features for a point-and-shot size camera. Perfect for SLR enthusiasts that would like to have an alternate small camera to carry in your pocket, and at the same time have all the manual adjustments of an SLR. Of course is not the same as an SLR, but it has all major features like RAW files, aperture and speed priority, manual control. The controls are easy and well located. The wheel around the lenses are perfect as a second adjustment control. Flash level can be adjusted, avoiding saturated light when shooting near the person. Also very nice for people that want to start learning photography and don&apos;t wanna invest in an full SLR.</Review>

     <Review>Pros: Image quality, lens quality, wide angle, size, adjustment options

Cons: Wrist strap sticks to velcro, frays easily. That&apos;s it.

Used it on a bicycling tour of Vietnam and Cambodia a week after purchasing it. Two of my photos were purchased and published in print and on the web by a global adventure travel co. Tiny camera contains Canon&apos;s full sized image capture chip. It records very sharp detail delivered through the camera&apos;s outstanding wide angle lens. Compact size allowed me to shoot pix with one hand while biking through crazy city traffic, on dirt roads dodging pot holes and animals, and some sneaky pix of people in markets.. Bright display. Image adjustment options to match a pro level SLR make it a super flexible, super quality little bomb of a camera. My first o ... ne was stolen. Had to buy the exact same model. Nothing else compares.

     <Review>Pros: Nice Body Color; Great image quality; Good Image Stabilization

Cons: Limited Zoom

Well, I just got this camera, and it is a lot different from the previous Canon PowerShot ones I&apos;ve owned. More complicated settings, and I am not sure I like the &quot;automatic&quot; macro feature. So far the photos are very nice and crisp, clear, true colors. I really might give it 5 stars after I get to know it better, but so far the controls are not intuitive, so I ding&apos;ed it one star. Also, for the price, I think there should be more than 3.8x zoom, after all, there are other P&amp;S cameras with up to 10x!</Review>

     <Review>Pros: Its sleek its got everything you want or need and its easy to use

Cons: Its expensive for what it has to offer. and Its has no touch screen.

Its good for people wanting a high end point and shoot camera. It does have a bit to lack for its price. one no touch screen. and It should have a memory card at least 4GB. and at least 12 mp would be nice. for four hundred its not the best value but is very sleek. and has features you would expect. and is a good camera.</Review>

     <Review>Pros: Good in Low Light; Great Zoom; Good Image Stabilization; Video Audio great

Cons: Camera case poor quality; Smooth body is slippery

Used this camera at a wedding a few days after receiving it. Even though I did not have a lot of &quot;practice&quot; time before I used it, the photos and videos came out great. It really took great pics in the low light at the reception. If you purchase this camera with a kit that has the &quot;DigPro&quot; case included, I suggest that you not use this case. After only a few times of removing the camera from the case and replacing it, the zipper broke. I&apos;ve since bought the Canon case made for the camera. It is more expensive, but the camera fits perfectly and it uses a magnetic flap which allows easier &quot;in and out&quot; and keeps it secure when closed. I would ... still recommend that you buy the kit because even without the case it is a good value. The only other problem I have is holding on to the camera. The body is very smooth and therefore the camera is slippery. The hand strap saved me from dropping it a few times already. I emailed Canon support about this and suggested that they consider producing a body that is rough/grainy on future models.

     <Review>Decided to get an additional P&amp;S to carry in lieu of a large DSLR. Read all the reviews and found this camera to fit my needs. I would recommend this camera for those who are comfortable with manipulating settings to get the most out of it however it does have a nice A automatic mode where a beginner would be able to grow into all its options to control settings. The only cons I have found so far is that the focus mode has a difficult time in very dim/dark settings. The small slick body does not build confidence where I feel as if the camera can slip out of my hands. The control ring seem to be made of plastic, could improve by matching it&apos;s material of metal on the ring. At the end of the day, the pros out weigh the cons... This truly is a camera I can carry with me in a nice ... small package and know I would be able to capture nice photos. I am historically a Nikon advocate but cannot say enough that Canon hit a home run with the S90.

     <Review>I just bought this camera two weeks ago and i absolutely love it. I knew a bit about f-stops and ISO controls before, but its always been a bit complicated. However, this camera has a fantastic interface that explains all the settings on the screen. Also, the the two spinning dials are totally intuitive, so you can quickly play with settings and experiment easily with different effects. I haven&apos;t had to even look at the manual and I&apos;ve been taking some fantastic shots. The only downside is a slightly short battery life and the zoom is not hugely powerful, but to be honest I haven&apos;t really been bothered by either.</Review>

     <Review>We sent this camera back because it has a hard time in auto focus and a point and shoot camera should be great at auto focus. It has very nice color balance and when it could get the shot the images were very nice indeed - but it missed the shot too many times. The focus troubles occured in low light. We use the camera for family snap-shots.</Review>

     <Review>The s90 received rave reviews from many of the photo blogs and I think the praise is well deserved. For it&apos;s small size, the s90 has the best photo quality and low light performance that I&apos;ve seen. The colors are vivid and saturated (far more more than in real life) and this camera tends to flatter anything it captures. No, the s90 is not a substitute for an SLR, but at it&apos;s best it can rival the quality of an entry level SLR at half of the price and a quarter of the size. I&apos;ll be happy to have an s90 in my pocket for my upcoming trip to Europe.</Review>

     <Review>Bought this camera for our honeymoon. Both my wife and use pro level Canon SLRs but didn&apos;t want to have to take them and worry about them during the trip. Being the first trip that I didn&apos;t travel without my 1d I was pretty skeptical of this camera. It was great! We used it on manual mode the entire trip shooting in RAW and the photos turned out really nicely. The manual controls are by far the easiest I have seen on a point and shoot. After a few minutes of playing with the camera it felt pretty natural. It&apos;s not a replacement for an SLR by any means but it takes some really nice photos. My only real complaint about this camera is that it does not shoot high definition video. the standard definition that it does record looks does the job. RAW capability and size was the big selling p ... oint for me. Great product!

     <Review>This camera is for serious amateur and professional photographers as a backup camera and to have with them when a larger SLR camera is not practical to carry. It is also suited for the beginner who wishes to grow their skills before making a really major investment. You can use it as a point and shoot on full Auto or as an artistic tool on full manual. With a 4Gb memory card, it will also take up to 45 minutes of regular video. If you are the type of person who only wants a fully automatic point and shoot, Canon does make less expensive cameras. Although often criticised for the ease with which one of the controls on the back can be accidentally turned, because of how this control is used, I have not found that to be a problem. The camera seems well made and sturdy. The camera has enoug ... h flexibility and controls to satisfy even the strictest techy. The only problem I have had is getting use to the dial around the lens and the hand placement when trying to use this dial and keeping my finger on the shutter button. I love the programmable function buttons and dials. I traded up from a Canon SD800IS and I am glad that I did. My main camera is a Nikon D-300.

     <Review>Usually the word compromise is considered a negative. But when one wants the best of two diametrically opposite worlds, coming up with a solution can be tricky. Well, Canon has done it. I have a great DSLR (Canon 7D) but it&apos;s bulky and just can&apos;t be taken everywhere. I have a great pocket camera, an old Canon SD800IS but it doesn&apos;t give me the controls that I want. So I searched for the best quality, most adjustable camera that can fit easily in one&apos;s pocket and the S90 was it. The images are first rate. I can shoot RAW+JPG. I can control a host of settings quickly and easily. A Perfect Compromise! And that&apos;s a good thing.</Review>

     <Review>Pros: Decent low light, great controls for a compact

Cons: It is a compact, no HD video

This is a great compact camera. I usually use a digital SLR, so for me there are a bunch of compromises with a compact, but it fits in a pocket, so that is a good tradeoff.

It has pretty good low light capabilities, and the picture quality is great in good light.

The controls are great, with the back control wheel and the lens ring control.

It is still a lot slower to take pictures with than a dSLR, but that is a general problem with compacts.

It would be nice if it had HD video, but that is a minor thing for me.</Review>

     <Review>Pros: Short Lag Time; Great Zoom; Good Image Stabilization; Good in Low Light

Cons: Camera more difficult

This one was bought for my wife, who is a bit of a Luddite but likes the simplicity of use on full auto. She doesn&apos;t shoot much, so film stays in her camera forever. But she doesn&apos;t care for computers, either. But the image quality, ease of use, and accuracy of autofocus have won her over - even if I still have to handle the uploading and print orders. It&apos;s the first Canon in the house (I&apos;m a Nikon bigot), and the price is right in the same range as some pretty capable P-series Nikons. But for a compact, easy to use yet flexible enough for anyone desiring more control, this may well be the best one available right now. Shutter lag is much better than on my waterproof Pent ... ax, a bit more than on any of my Nikons - but it&apos;s just something that requires a bit of getting accustomed, rather than a problem. Overall, a great camera for what it&apos;s intended to be.

     <Review>Pros: Takes excellent photo&apos;s for its&apos;s size

Cons: A little hard to hold, wish it had been cheaper!

I really like the s90. I have only used it a little more than a month but it does a lot of things for a point and shoot camera this tiny. The tiny part is why I didn&apos;t give it five stars for ease of use. I purchased Richard Franic&apos;s accessory grip and it helps tremendously but it is still tough. I am going to cut some small strips of adhesive backed sand paper and apply them in strategic places. I do have some trouble with my ability to grip small items and I always have so it probably wouldn&apos;t apply to everyone.
Several other complaints that I read about this camera before I purchased it were that the flash was in a bad position and the adjustment wheel was easily moved acc ... identally. I haven&apos;t found this to be the case, yes the flash is in a position that your finger normally rests but where else could they put it? I haven&apos;t had any problem at all with the wheel even before I added the accessory grip. It has been a non- issue.
I haven&apos;t even began to touch all of the possibilities of the adjustments available. It takes wonderful pictures when you get it right and there is always the programmed presets if you need them. I need to spend some more time to learn everything that it can do but that is the great part, learning it all!
It is an expensive camera in this range but it has so much to offer for the money you are spending. It is as close to a DSLR as you can slip in your pocket.
Best Buy dropped the price $30.00 the day I went shopping for it, if that wasn&apos;t a sign I don&apos;t know what one would be. I feel like I have bought the last point and shoot camera I will ever need.

     <Review>If you are looking for a camera that fits into your jeans pocket this is a good choice. It takes good pictures during the day (ISO 100) or if it&apos;s mounted on a tripod. However be ware that if you are not using a tripod and go above ISO 500 you will have a lot of noise in your pictures. Also it shows some noise in high contrast scenes as well even at ISO 320. Be prepared to tweak it to get some decent color. Given the size of the camera I am ok with the IQ. This is a good compact camera if you understand its limitations. I would rather have some noise in my pictures than not have an image that I liked just because I did not feel like carrying my DSLR that day. Trek-Tech has a little grip/clamp called VersaMount I highly recommend it with this camera.</Review>

     <Review>I use the Canon s90 for everything. I don&apos;t care about shooting HD videos or I would buy a HD video camera. Great for landscapes and people pics. Fantastic macro ability. I leave my SLR at home and carry the s90 everywhere. It&apos;s so light I can&apos;t even tell it&apos;s in my pocket. With the beautiful 3 inch screen who needs a viewfinder. I haven&apos;t found anything I don&apos;t like about it.</Review>

     <Review>This camera is by far my favorite point and shoot to date. The ability to control aperture and exposure compensation with two click wheels is amazing and extremely fast. I have rather large hands and always struggled with tiny little buttons on other pocket point and shoots - with a large programmable wheel on the front (mine is set to aperture) and a smaller wheel for your thumb on the back (exposure comp) it&apos;s very easy to get it right in camera. I&apos;m really impressed with the overall image quality and the reviews on the sensor used for this camera give it very high honors. With so many compact cameras cramming as many pixels as they can on a sensor - its refreshing to see more models utilizing quality over quantity. Some people gripe about the lack of HD on the video -- meh, it wo ... uld have been nice but the quality is good enough for my needs. I&apos;m just happy that I don&apos;t have to try and cram my LX3 in a pocket anymore! This camera is just the right size for a pocket yet still big enough to not feel like a kids toy.

     <Review>This is a very cool little camera. Cool because it has a bright (f/2.0) wide (20mm eqiv) lens. Cool because it has lots of manual controls and a unique control ring around the lens barrel where aperture rings used to be. The lens is very sharp, and image quality is very good. The ability to shoot RAW with manual controls in a very pocketable body is paramount to me. This is a camera to always have with you, one which won&apos;t disappoint in poor lighting conditions and offers lots of flexibility for the advanced shooter. Not really a beginners camera, a bit pricey for most, but the overall mix of control, IQ and size make it worth the money for me. ...</Review>

     <Review>Pros: picture quality is better than most point and shoot cameras

Cons: there&apos;s a lot to remember

THis camera takes great shots with very low noise. I&apos;m impressed by the quality of the shots even with the ISO set as high as 400. With a lens opening of f2 and the cleanliness of the shots this camera takes low light pictures better than any other small camera that I have owned. If you are interested in a pocket camera that is good in low light this one is a very good choice. It is definitely targeted for the photo buff because there is no HD video and that&apos;s fine with me because I bought this camera for photos, not video. The control rings are a fantastic aid to getting better shots. They supply more control than any other small camera. It also takes pictures in raw format. I h ... ighly recomend this camera.

     <Review>My main camera is the 5DM2 but sometimes it is too big to take along. I bought the s90 for those times and I really like the following features three feature. One, it is very small and easily fits in a jacket pocket or front pants pocket (this was the most important criterion). Two, the S90 gives you the ability to control aperture, shutter and ISO easily, unlike many small point and shoot cameras that only work in pre-set program modes. I shoot almost exclusively in Aperture Preferred so I set the front ring around the lens to aperture and the shortcut button to ISO. This way, I can quickly pick the aperture and ISO combination that gives me the minimum shutter I need. I have tried shots with the ISO up to 1600 and the noise level is quite good although one would probably not want t ... o try a 11x17 print from this camera. Third, this camera will shoot Canon Raw format in addition to JPegs. One slight annoyance is the problem I had getting it set to take Raw + Jpeg. While the menu system has a spot to select Raw + Jpeg on, the camera will not actually record the raw file. To make it do so, you have to go into the preferences menu and select Raw first.

     <Review>I was reluctant to buy the S90 because I love my Canon SD900! And I still do! I didn&apos;t think there was enough reason for me to upgrade. Even the midrange P&amp;S cameras had better zoom and HD video (come on Canon)! But I wanted a waterproof case for my trip and figured I might as well upgrade since the SD900 was over three years old. What I missed most are the ergonomic features. The SD900 was perfect in my hands. I could operate it single handedly. The S90 is not so smooth and some of the buttons are positioned in annoying places, including the on/off button. The popup flash is constantly in my way to where I have to disable it and only enable it when I want a flash. And the control dial changes my exposures without my knowledge. The best feature I like about this camera is t ... he low light option. It certainly delivers great images for a P&amp;S... WOW! I just wished it saved the low light images as LARGE and not MEDIUM, resulting in under 1MB pictures! Despite all this and the cost, it&apos;s still a great camera and I will keep it!

     <Review>Pros: excellent pictures for pocket camera

The S90 is probably the best camera you can buy that will fit in your pocket. It&apos;s sensor (1/1.7&apos;) is roughly twice the size of most compact cameras. The pictures are clear and beautiful, even in low light. I was tired of blurry or otherwise poor pictures from other cameras, so I bought the S90 and am very pleased. The camera is easy to use, and the feature set is great.

The main complaint that I&apos;ve read about is ergonomics. I&apos;m a 6&apos; male and have had no problems. The zoom is 3.7x, so this is not the camera for an activity like bird watching.</Review>

     <Review>Pros: Myriad of picture and operational settings.

Cons: Clunky power zoom, limited zoom range.

The PowerShot S90 is a great camera. With 100&apos;s of different point-and-shoot cameras available, I was looking for one that provided above average parameter settings to allow for more creative shots without having to go to a standard 35MM DSLR body size. This camera definitely delivers in this respect.

I&apos;ve only had the camera a couple of weeks and have not had a lot of time to work with it yet, but I&apos;m certainly pleased with it so far. It starts up fast and the &quot;auto&quot; mode works fine for most shooting situations.

Because there are so many things that can be adjusted with the settings, the use of a &quot;lens ring&quot; and &quot;dial around cursor buttons&quot; for changing settings is ve ... ry helpful. Depending on the shooting mode you are in, a dial around the lens will make one adjustment, then the other dial allows secondary adjustment preventing the need for digging through layers of menus. It will take a while to master all the different mode configurations, but it&apos;s a novel approach.

The only thing I would complain about is the power optical zoom is not as smooth as you would expect on a camera at this price level. The zoom adjustment is a tiny little lever too that&apos;s a bit hard to operate. The overall build quality and feel of the device is excellent.

I would recommend this camera for people who DO want to dig into making adjustments to the shooting parameters. If you just want a camera to snap decent shots, then it would be unnecessary overkill and you can probably find something good at half the price.

     <Review>They say the best camera is the one you have with you. This camera is small enough to take anywhere, and takes superb pictures. The only drawback is the lack of a hotshoe, but it&apos;s a small price to pay for portability. It takes pictures just as good as the g11, maybe even better because of the faster lens. I love the ring control as well.</Review>

This is a good camera that you can use in most of your daily life, especially excellent for the night use. The function is good, and the batery is also lasted long. Although it doesn&apos;t have the HD vedio function, it&apos;s vedio function is still satisfy. The only thing I don&apos;t like is it&apos;s not good to capture the moving moment and the price is a litte bit expensive. After all, a good camera and worth buying.</Review>

     <Review>Canon S90 offers a great deal of versatility and manual controls when compared to most cameras of this size. In fact, the S90 sports many of the same features we saw on the G11 but it is a camera that you will carry with you because of its size. The S90 also performs very well when using its higher ISO capabilities. I was able to capture some high-quality photos without a problem; the photo&apos;s look fantastic in low light. That said, the S90 does capture good video, with very little noise and smooth playback but not in HD. The microphone produces decent audio and hand no problems picking up an array of sounds. The S90&apos;s battery life was good but I would recommend picking up a spare battery for travel and uninterrupted picture taking. Simply this is the best compact I have ever seen , you wi ... ll love it.

     <Review>I&apos;ve had a Canon SD630 for a few years now, but I wanted a carry-around camera that had the ability to shoot at least in aperture- and shutter-priority modes. I also wanted to try my hand at shooting RAW. I looked at the G11, but it was a little on the large side. The S90 was the perfect choice for me! I get great low-light shots, picture quality is excellent, and I have all the manual control I need. Furthermore, unlike my old SLR, it&apos;s small and light enough that it actually leaves the house with me! I no longer miss great shots because I don&apos;t have my camera with me. Highly recommended.</Review>

     <Review>One of the best point and shoot cameras out in the market. The ease of using the camera is fantastic. The ring feature isn&apos;t too necessary, but quite unique. Picture quality isn&apos;t grainy or blurry. It turns out a lot better than other canon p&amp;s like sd1200 or sd780is. If you need a camera under low light conditions, this is the camera for you.The screen is huge for previewing. Overall, best P&amp;S camera I&apos;ve used. Although the price is expensive, it is well worth the price. ...</Review>

     <Review>The case feels very substantial, and it never leaked during a week long rafting trip. I used it under water (maybe 2 feet) and in very wet and rough conditions, and it did great. All knobs and buttons held up to rough handling. The buttons and knobs take some getting used to. It&apos;s a good idea to spend a day using it in its case to get familiar with how to actuate all the functions. Only three minor nits: the image quality (especially in sunny conditions) was noticeably lower than without the case. The flash doesn&apos;t work particularly well because the camera bulk shades it. It comes with a diffuser, but I was afraid it would fall off. Also, a more minor nit, I suppose, the microphone doesn&apos;t do well in the case when shooting video, but I can&apos;t see how they could improve on that. It ... does work, but you&apos;ll mostly hear the shooter&apos;s voice, not the subjects&apos;.

     <Review>I&apos;ve had a Nikon P5200 since 2004. I love it still because it fits in my jeans front pocket so I carry it a lot and it takes great photos. I have been waiting until a worthy replacement came along that did everything as well as the P5200, fits neatly in my jeans pocket, an has manual controls. Nikon seems to be obsessed with low end point and shoots these days, so this loyal Nikon fan had to switch brands. The Canon S90 delivers. I&apos;ve always thought that 5 Mpix was enough for a point shoot, especially as more pixels on a small sensor just adds more noise. But the S90 is not bad, and with manual controls and optical vibration reduction I find myself shooting at ASA 80 almost all the time with great results. That said, there are three things Canon missed out on. They should have give ... n this to a review panel before releasing it. (a) The wheel control on the back of the camera is too easy to spin, it needs to have a click mechanism like the lens ring control. This drives me nuts - sometimes I accidentally move the EV setting just as I take the photo. (b) My P5200 was faster when taking continuous photos. (c) No distortion correction for wide angle. Nikon does it on low end cameras - c&apos;mon Canon - get off the grass! I almost returned the camera on account of these dissapointments, but hey, it&apos;s not a perfect camera world and I&apos;m learning to live with the S90&apos;s touchy dial. And I wish it had a &apos;bulb&apos; mode for the shutter, is that too hard to do? Four stars instead of five.

     <Review>I use mine as my carry-around camera. It lives in my briefcase. It has a wide variety of modes--from automatic point and shoot JPEGS to fully manual RAW images. Great RAW images up to ISO 400. The LCD is great for the size of the camera. I wished there was a greater zoom range on both ends.</Review>

     <Review>Pros: SLR features and flexibility

Cons: pop up flash. Ergonomics

I&apos;m an amateur photographer and have been able to fulfill a large aprt of my photographic needs with an old 3.2 megapixel canon sd200. Although I&apos;m planning to get an SLR to have the greatest number of possibilities, most of my good pictures have been taken in places and at times where an SLR would just be too cumbersome (cycling trip, skiing, rock climbing day, at a bar, etc...) The S90 off course is not an SLR, but it is a portable point and shoot that offers SLR-like features and greatly expands the scope of everyday photography. The image quality is great and I have always found Canon&apos;s software to be really intuituve and its logic has not changed since I got my SD 200 in 2003. So for whoever owns a canon, ... the software will be super easy to navigate through. The pop up flash is a problem that has been reported by many reviewers because it pops up exaclty where we&apos;re used to have our index finger. Otherwise, the camera could benefit from a small ridge/something to make more ergonomic and its hold more secure. It is a bit expensive as well. Overall a very good buy so far. Lets see if it lasts for a few years.

     <Review>This camera offers the flexibility of a digital SLR with only a slight compromise in image quality. I have a Canon 5D and a Canon 20D and the images are very good from this camera, especially at higher ISO settings. The ring around the lens adds a level of convenience not found in most pocket cameras. The only cons I can find are the moderate zoom and in my opinion the shutter release button is in a poor location. Two small things considering the overall ability of this little pocket rocket.</Review>

     <Review>It is a good point and shoot with great optics but rather expensive. It is not a Leica in terms of picture quality. It is useful for scenic photography and not anything that is moving. Buy a Nikon D40, for less and have more flexibility. Hurry as they are discontinued. If pocket size is a must, similar quality can be had for half the cost, and from Canon. I have had 6 Canon point and shoots, starting with the G2, which I still love. My Leica LX 4 is great, takes a superb photo, but also expensive.</Review>

     <Review>This camera is simply the best point and shoot camera ever. The images are stunning and the manual controls give you so many options that you can be as creative as you want. The control rings on the front and rear of the camera a very intuitive and easy to get a handle on. Setting exposure, ISO, even manual focus is a snap, and exploring the features is the easiest way to get started. For Novices and Pros alike, this camera will satisfy. Low light performance is alright, as expected with the size of the sensor, and Canon&apos;s processing is second to no ones in my opinion. The colors are vivid and pop. I have had many other powershots over the years, and still have my SD990, which I love, but this takes it to a whole new level, do not hesitate to buy it.</Review>

     <Review>Pros: Manual Controls, Image Quality, Size, Ergonomics

This little gem is performing so well in low light situations that everything else in the same price range just falls in the shade. Even at 400 ISO it performs way better than Panasonic LX3 and Leica D-Lux 4. At any number higher than 400 ISO it has no other compact competitor. It has good optics, good dynamic range, RAW capability, manual settings and a programmable ring which is very useful. You won&apos;t find another camera at this size, at this price with this image quality and all those features. A must have.</Review>

     <Review>This is one serious little camera, I have owned numerous Canon Elphs over the years starting with the SD200 and more recently the SD990. The SD200 was a great little camera that recently died, but I have had the SD1000, SD870, recently purchased the SD780, which I love for the size and HD Video, and an SD990 with a underwater housing. I think Canon makes the best digital point and shoots and Nikon makes the best DSLR&apos;s. With that said, the S90 is in a class by itself. It combines the features of the G series cameras with the size of the Elph line. The manual controls are easy to use and the performance of this little gem is unbelievable. It is what it is, a superior point and shoot. So far I have really enjoyed using the exposure bracketing feature and have just scratched the surface, but ... I&apos;m sure there will be a lot more to enjoy. As a Mac user, the only drawback is that there is no support for the Canon RAW format yet with Snow Leopard, so the S90 and G11 RAW files can only be read by Canon&apos;s proprietary software. I&apos;m sure support will come on Apples next update. The camera has decent low light performance, but so does my SD990, like I said, it is what it is, not to be used for action shots or nighttime shooting, but, it does better than the previous generation of sensors with the DIGIC IV processor. What&apos;s not to like.

     <Review>Pros: Great image quality; Packed with features

I got this camera for Christmas last year and it was my favorite gift. The camera is very compact so I can take it everywhere I go without much of a hassle. There are many professional features built into this that are very useful for great pictures. Good aperture settings and the quality of my pictures are amazing. The buttons on the camera are really nicely spaced so it&apos;s more convenient for large hands. What I really like about this camera is that it feels really sturdy. It has a nice weight to it and the outer shell is a very solid plastic, not thin or light like other cameras. It&apos;s a good camera to use if you know how to adjust the settings because I find manual mode doesn&apos;t do my pictures justice most of the time, but t ... hat&apos;s just my opinion.

     <Review>Pros: Great image quality; Easy to use; Packed with features; fast f/2 lenses; Full manual control

Cons: Slippery surface

For a pocketable camera, the S90 has nearly everything that I&apos;m looking for.

One thing that&apos;s always frustrated me with compact point-and-shoot cameras is the lack of full manual controls and actually having the ability to control the shot how I want it. Too often I&apos;m left to the mercy of the cameras and micro-chips deciding how my pictures should look instead of my natural creative talents. A camera&apos;s not really a camera unless if it unleashes your ability to somewhat have control and create your final shot. The S90 delivers on all those accounts. I&apos;m able to pre-set focal lenghts, focus-zones, and on a whim, customize how my photo should look.
 ... 
Regarding images, except when shooting at higher-ISO&apos;s, the images are great up to ISO 400. If you&apos;re expecting images that have depth to them, like what you&apos;ll see from micro-four-thirds and larger sensors, you will end up dissapointed. For a camera it&apos;s size, though, it really delivers.

     <Review>Pros: Great image quality; Packed with features; Easy to use; fast f/2 lenses; Full manual control

Cons: screen scratches easiily

I have not buy a pocket point and shoot camera for a while, my previous one was a Canon s230 point and shoot from 2003.

Most of the time I shoot with my DSLR, the current one I have is a Nikon D80.

Canon s90 definitely performed well to shoot as a compliment for my Nikon DSLR, I know the theory and the logic behind photography, so I really don&apos;t need the fancy functions such as double LCD (front and back like some of the Samsungs) or some other fancy stuff. All I need is a pocketable camera that takes good pictures.

It really can get the job done! The picture quality is good enough, maybe not as good as my DSLR, but it&apos;s defini ... tely better than most of the point and shoot out there.

It has a F2.0 lens as well as a 28-105mm zoom, the big aperature just gives you so much more of light to work with in the low-light settings.

The manual operation is quite smooth and intuitive. In some occasion you want to shoot casually, this gives you focus more on the subject instead of thinking behind the viewfinder, toggling the function menu and try to figure out how are you going to shoot.

Overall, I would definitely recommend this camera to anyone!

     <Review>Pros: Great image quality; Easy to use; Packed with features

Cons: Slippery surface; Loose Wheel

Im not an avid photographer or anything, but have owned over 5 cameras over the last 10 years.  I generally purchase simple point and shoot cameras such as the SD110 and the SD 550,  I can tell you that the S90 is by far and way the best point and shoot camera on the market.  I did a ton of research prior to purchasing this camera.  The low light picture taking is great as are all the available functions.   The body is sleek, maybe a little too slippery, and the wheel on the back panel is a bit loose, but once you are used to it, youll see just how great this little camera is!

The S90 shares a lot of common components with the bigger G11.  The G11 is also tauted as one of t ... he best cameras out there. The battery life seems good.  I have gotten close to 200 pictures on one charge.  I wish the video mode had an HD option but it does not. I believe the S95 has this option.  Overall, this camera has made me extremely happy, allowing me to take great images of nature, rockets, skylines, and much more.

     <Review>Incredible. I love this camera. I&apos;m an avid (sometimes pro, mostly for fun) photographer. Until now, I&apos;ve been a Nikon user, but this little camera has changed my mind completely. I&apos;m now saving for a Canon t2i. What&apos;s great- takes crystal clear, beautiful shots. Fantastic low-light capacity. Dummy-proof for those with less photography experience. Takes great HD videos too! One small challenge is that the menu is a bit difficult to use and takes some times getting used to. Also, flash is typical of any small camera.</Review>

     <Review>This camera blows away everything else I&apos;ve seen in terms of soaking in all available light to produce realistic looking photos of inside shots. Seriously: tired of tossing pics because your subjects are dark? I was. Both WIRED magazine and NYTimes call this camera (and it&apos;s successor, the S95, if you want to pay another hundred bucks for the same basic thing) the very, very top. DSLR type pics for just over 300$??? Incredible. My family pics and outdoor landscapes, colors, and ESPECIALLY close ups look like National Geographic shots. In fact, I lost my first one and didn&apos;t think twice about buying a duplicate. Now, all my friends have one and family members, within a few months of showing S90 pictures to them. They can&apos;t believe it. Plus, AUTO function essentially does it all. ... Easiest camera I EVER USED.

     <Review>Pros: fast f/2 lenses; Great image quality; Packed with features

I needed a new camera before our vacation to Europe this year. Portability and photo quality were two of the most important things I was looking for. I was interested in stepping up to a better camera with more manual options because I am interested in taking more control with my photos. I think this camera is perfect for anyone looking to step up from the point and shoot world without moving all the way to a Digital SLR. This camera combines portable size with a high performance lens that opens all the way to F2.0. This enables great low light and indoor shots without having to use flash! It has a ton of shooting modes ranging from full manual to full auto mode, which makes it easy for a variety of people to pick up a ... nd use. A lot of people complain about it being &quot;slippery&quot;, but I have had NO problems with this. It feels good in my hands and takes AMAZING pictures with the light it has available. You will not regret buying this camera!

     <Review>The image quality of this camera is so excellent, it helps you forgive the slight shutter delay when taking pictures. It is fun to use and allows for a lot of manual control, which many other digital point and shoots do not. The flash works well and is powerful enough to light your subjects in a flattering way. Definitely get a second battery! It lasts for a while, but when it starts to fall off, it does so quickly.</Review>

     <Review>I have been very pleased with this camera in the three weeks I&apos;ve had it. It can be easily set to function as a point-and-shoot, and it works admirably in that mode. However, it has so many capabilities that I am still learning them. The User Guide is well-written, but it could be considerably larger in size. I realize that the manufacturer wants to put out a guide that is easily portable, but, as one explores the many abilities of this beautifully-made camera, it would be very nice to have the directions in larger print. Packing all the details for a machine of this complexity into 178 4X6 pages is well-intentioned but silly. I&apos;d like to be able to relax with the manual, rather than squint at it. Learning from the guide while in the field might be tough. Great camera, though.</Review>

     <Review>I bought this camera because I wanted a small camera to travel with (I pack light!). This camera is very nice and compact, but retains the capability to modify camera settings. I took it on a trip to Germany, and I&apos;m thrilled with the pictures I got. I was concerned about not having a viewfinder, but that was not a problem at all. The screen is bright enough to see the image even in sunlit conditions.</Review>

     <Review>Pros: Large Clear LCD; Good Image Stabilization; Small / Compact; Good in Low Light; Good Image Quality; Easy To Use

Cons: Lag / Shutter Delay

This camera was chosen to replace our SD870 which suffered a lens failure after many years of use. It is primarily used when carrying a larger D-SLR is difficult. So mostly we use it for travel, mostly motorcycle travel where size and weight are critical. It has met our needs so far. It&apos;s already been used on a motorcycle trip to Yellowstone with good results. The S90 is easy to use. It works well in full auto mode but provides the option of manual override of many things if desired. I particularly like ISO 80 with its crisp detail. Shutter and Aperature priority are available if needed. The front control ring is a nice feature a ... nd makes the camera feel more professional. The only negative in my mind is the lag time for action sequences. The lag is mostly noticeable when coming from a digital SLR. All-in-all a great choice as a small, compact camera with a host of features for most uses.

     <Review>Great camera. Love the manual mode. Images turned out awsome. I am impressed by the performance under a low light condition and the night shots were beautiful. Very user friendly too. Unfortunately, it does not have HD video and the battery life is not long. It&apos;s recommanded to get an extra battery for travel.</Review>

     <Review>I wanted a RAW-shooting compact point and shoot with solid glass and sensor, and this delivers fully on all counts. Program mode with the ability to adjust exposure on the fly got me fantastic shots in a shoot-from-the-hip mode, contrast looks great, and the function wheel around the lens is a surprisingly nice touch. My one complaint is battery life. I used the bulk of three batteries over the course of a week/about 300 shots. If I can find a longer-lived aftermarket battery pack, I&apos;ll be completely ecstatic with this purchase. Overall great.</Review>

     <Review>I love this camera housing! It worked great for my needs. I went to Hawaii last week and toted it around with me to every beach we went to. My photos came out a lot clearer than they would&apos;ve if i used a disposable camera. The photo clarity underwater usually depended on the clarity of the water - Hawaii has beautiful &apos;blue&apos; water which was pretty clear most of the time. I found it easy to use the camera&apos;s features (zoom, flash, etc) and navigate through the different menus even when I was in the middle of snorkeling. Make sure to read the user manual prior to using the camera housing. It contains important instructions on how to prepare your housing before use and how to care for it when you aren&apos;t using it. Gotta protect your investment that&apos;s protecting your investment rig ... ht? Don&apos;t think about it any more S90 owners...just buy it already! You&apos;ll love it too :-)

     <Review>The ring function makes this camera special and gives you more control. You can choose what you want the ring to do-I like to have it adjust the f/stop and the shutter. The pictures are clear and crisp-great photo quality. The camera is a little slower, but that is after being used to using a DSLR. I have a hard time focusing when I try to take macro photo.</Review>

     <Review>I am a busy mother of 2 boys 8 months and 23 months. I use this camera for all our family pictures. We had a Cannon elph and had to replace it. So far, this one appears to take better pictures and the auto mode helps you focus on the faces in the picture. We are hoping to take great family pics at the beach. The size is wonderful to carry everywhere!</Review>

     <Review>Pros: pictures look great

Cons: flash and controls

this canon is a little more expensive than most point and shoot. I have a rebel xti and old canon a85. I am replacing the a85 with this one. I like point and shoots to bring to places where I don&apos;t want to carry my dslr.
well, this camera takes pics as well as my rebel. Don&apos;t like the flash popping up. Wish they had mounted on front. My finger is always in the way. The controls are a little getting used to with control ring and back ring. I accidentally keep changing things. I am sure once I get the hang of it, it will be a snap. Really love how the pics come out though. Battery life doesn&apos;t seem to be that great. After charging the 1st time, it seemed it ran down kind of quick.</Review>

     <Review>I think it is great! It is small, portable, takes fabulous pictures and is customizable. If you can&apos;t already tell, I am not a professional or especially adept. I am learning and I think this a great camera to do that on- you can manipulate the settings or work within their many presets/auto function. The only draw back is the moving ring on the back- it is very sensitve and I have definitley switched modes by accident a few times. It aso does have a bit of trouble focusing sometimes- I&apos;m still working out all the kinks. Overall, I&apos;m very happy that I have it- the pictures are gorgeous so far!</Review>

     <Review>[...]This case screams quality,everything about it is made to last, i have not tested it out in much deeper than 5-7 meters of water. Takes an already top of the line camera and makes it more versatile. Picture quality is fantastic. all the buttons are clearly marked on the case itself,great price, great product. protects the camera at the same time as adding another element to this camera already large list of features.</Review>

     <Review>This is a great camera if you like the small size and weight of a compact digital camera but dont want to lose the manual capabilities of a DSLR camera. The two-ring function (one in the lens and the other in the back) is great when you get accostumed to it. The one thing i dont like is that is a little slow in how much photographs per second you can take, compared to other cameras.</Review>

     <Review>This highly rated compact digital camera does not disappoint. I love having access to every element of exposure. Even in auto mode, I noticed that the camera correctly set itself to macro mode for closeups, and also correctly chose a flash fill mode for indoor photographs which allowed for more of the background to be seen. Having all of this creative control in such a small package makes it a joy to carry around. The best feature: a 28mm F2 lens for low light situations.</Review>

     <Review>Originally bought this to supplement my Canon 1DMKIII as a pocketable alternative. Nice build quality, I like the front control ring, and the image quality. It is compact and if you have large hands, you may find it too small. After using a DSLR for so many years, it was also hard to get used to not having a view finder. If you&apos;re looking for a high end, compact, point and shoot it&apos;s hard to beat the S90. My problem was that it was too small. It was hard to hold with confidence that I wouldn&apos;t fumble it. If you&apos;re used to small cameras, you&apos;ll love it. For now, I&apos;ll stick with the Canon Rebel when I need something smaller.</Review>

     <Review>If you are looking for a compact camera with plenty of manual features, this is the camera to look at. I am a professional photographer, and wanted a small compact to use when it is not convenient to bring my SLR. I took time to search the internet, and this was at the top of the list. Amazing sharp photos, in any lighting conditions, with intuitive aperture/shutter priority settings with a rotating ring on the front base of the camera lens. You will love this camera especially at entertainment events and shows where they do not allow flash photography. Cameras with only scene settings can not measure up to this power packed camera.</Review>

     <Review>I took this baby on vacation and it did exactly what I needed. It is easy to carry, easy to use, the images are crisp &amp; clear. Downloading to my computer is fast and simple. The only problem I encountered was when the flash decides to pop up and the index finger of my left hand is there holding the camera. I am now aware of the situation so I am retraining my left hand&apos;s position. That is a trade-off when you go from a full size SLR to a compact Point &amp; Shoot. Aside from that, the camera is impressive and well worth the purchase!!</Review>

Enough quality to take Professional looking photos..in those extreme conditions one does not want to risk your expensive gear in.</Review>

     <Review>I purchased the S-90 and left immediately for the Tetons and Yellowstone, leaving behind my larger camera. I came home with great pictures. I found the camera easy to use and enjoyed the fact that it allows manual settings of aperture, shutter speed and focus. Or I could be lazy and shoot in automatic mode. Only one small complaint: the back adjustment ring moves too easily and I had to continually monitor my hand position so I wouldn&apos;t change settings. Overall this is a very good small pocket camera.</Review>

     <Review>The pictures will hardly tell you how small this camera really is: it fits into a shirt pocket and other small compartments. This camera can be a steady companion for the pixel quality-oriented shooter. This camera is well-suited for those who want to leave their DSLR at home at times, but still like to have RAW pixel-editing capability. The zoom range is excellent, as are overall build and picture quality. It is hard to perceive that one can fit more real camera into a smaller case. Recommended for all pro/semipro-DSLR owners with need for an on-the-go camera solution.</Review>

     <Review>This is a great camera when you can&apos;t take your DSLR with you. Very low noise level for a point and shoot. Do not expect DSLR noise level though. I find ISO 800 definitely usable. ISO 1600 usable for smaller prints. Many people complain about ergonomics. I don&apos;t find it to be a problem if you don&apos;t have large hands, but it may take some time to figure out how to hold the camera. Once you learn the camera, pretty much any setting you are likely to change a lot is 1 or 2 seconds away.</Review>

     <Review>I use this camera when I don&apos;t want to carry my Canon DSLR. It&apos;s my first light and small camera. The pictures are sharp. The directions are clear. I haven&apos;t used it in low light. I am used to having large areas for holding a camera. I still push buttons or turn the wheel without meaning to. I think I will get used to that.</Review>

     <Review>Pros: Good in Low Light; Good Image Stabilization

Cons: Limited Zoom

I just got my S90 as a replacement for my broken Canon SD550. I tried the Casio Exilim series the day before, and I returned it right the way. I&apos;m impressed by the S90&apos;s performance: sharp images and low light performance for its class. The auto mode is so smart you rarely need to switch to manual mode, which is something fun because it works like a regular SLR in petite size. I would say the S90&apos;s image quality is very close to an entry level DSLR w/o the size and weight.</Review>

     <Review>Pros: Nice Body Color; Great Zoom; Good in Low Light; Good Image Stabilization; Short Lag Time

I decided to purchase it and use it on my vacation in DC,, NYC, Buffalo, and Niagara Falls. I chose the Canon Powershot S90 because I wanted the ease of a point and shoot and I wanted to be able to use it in my photography classes. It worked great in museums taking clear no flash pictures of art and artifacts in low light. The zoom was great for smaller objects d&apos;art as well as far away things like Niagara Falls. I couldn&apos;t believe how much detail there was with the great close-ups. Even pictures of scenery and famous sites taken on the top of tour buses and boats as well as in the AMTRAK train were clear. I took hundreds of pictures. I especially liked the ability to link pictures a ... nd the short lag time unlike my much older Sony which I still love to use for videos. I looked forward to using the manual features after my vacation when I could sit down and work my way through the manual, but my camera was stolen at the Smithsonian Castle on the last day of my vacation. Not sure what to do now.

     <Review>This camera is perfect for being spontaneous. It&apos;s lightweight, small size and discreet. it has good controls for people who like to be more creative and think about what they&apos;re shooting. The quality of the pics is amazing for the size of the chip. All round a great camera as a stand alone do anything point and shoot or a perfect compliment to your DSLR.</Review>

     <Review>I am very pleased with my S90! It comes very close to my Canon XTi DSLR in many ways. I did a lot of research before buying it, &amp; I&apos;m glad I bought it. The color is very crisp &amp; true. The size is just right ... not too big/not too small. I don&apos;t find the pop up flash a deal breaker at all. The easily moveable wheel on the back requires some watching, but it&apos;s not insurmountable either. The zoom range and the 2.0 lens are the reasons I bought the camera. I took photos on a swaying boat last weekend &amp; even though my hand &amp; the boat were moving, the photos came out very crisp &amp; not at all blurry. They matched almost what I could get with my XTi.</Review>

     <Review>Pros: Lens and program/manual control

Cons: needs better grip for left hand

I bought the SX210, found indoor shots of poor quality, returned it and ordered the S90. The S90 is about what I was looking for in a high end point and shoot. The lens is great, pretty fast indoor and out. The 10 MP is more than enough. It has plenty of program modes and still gives you manual control.

The only down side for me so far, is flash real easy to cover and lack of grip for left hand. I will probably order after market grip. I have not had a problem with the control dial that I know of. The S90 does not have a massive zoom lens but that&apos;s why we have slrs!

In closing, for the extra $18.00+/_ over the price of the SX210, I think I got over $100.00 more in value! I would have ra ... ted 5 stars had the grip been better.

     <Review>Pros: Sharp pictures, ease of use

Cons: No HD video

Owned the camera for a week and tested it by taking various shots during the day and night. The picture quality is amazingly sharp and using the camera is remarkably easy considering all the stuff that is in it. If you are lazy, the AUTO actually does a darn good job alone.

For night shots, it performed generally pretty good. Though don&apos;t expect it to perform at a quality level like a DSLR, I still had to have a steady hand for non-flash shots and it does recommend using a tripod for such shots. But if its a well lite outdoors area, you should be fine.

Overall I feel this was an excellent purchase, even if it is at the high-end of point and shoot cameras. Only issue I see is the the movie recorded doesn&apos;t do HD ... , but that&apos;s not why I purchased it anyway.

     <Review>I replaced our S80 with this and was impressed with the quality of photos from a much smaller camera. My only hesitation in buying this was the lack of an optical viewfinder. After all, I am a professional photographer and for 40 years, I have been looking for viewfinders. I think for a point-and-shoot, this works good. For action, it might be difficult to move with the subject. For a more pro camera, I want to focus through an optical viewfinder. The image quality and AE ability is very good. No HD video is a negative.</Review>

     <Review>I bought the camera to meet the requirements of a beginners&apos; digital photography class. It offers much more opportunity for individual control of settings than the (good) point-&amp;-shoot I have enjoyed for 2 years. Happily, the instructions in the Camera Guide and on the screen seem, so far, clear and easy to follow. so far, however, I am finding it a bit awkward to hold and I am not sure why. I am hoping this will resolve with repeated use.</Review>

     <Review>Pros: Brillant display; Possiblity of RAW; Good in Low Light; Good wide angle f20; Very Compact

Cons: Setting somet confusing; Slow

A good addition for the DSLR-equipment: small, compact, with a good RAW-picture quality. Also ideal for night shots (only a small tripod necessary) with 15 sec exposure time. 28mm wide angle with f2,0 cannot be beaten by most APS-C - sensor DSLR&apos;s - so ideal for evening shots. On the other side: slow focusing compared to a DSLR, sometimes diffuculty function settings. But: I don&apos;t know an overall better small camera.</Review>

     <Review>Pros: Short Lag Time; Good Image Stabilization; Great Zoom; Good in Low Light; Nice Body Color

Cons: Small for large hands

This little camera can do almost everything. The pictures I&apos;ve taken on the Auto setting even turned out wonderful. Does very well in low light conditions. The camera is small so it&apos;s difficult to hold onto at times (fixed this with an aftermarket grip). The dial on the back can be turned very easily so it takes practice to not jostle it while I&apos;m taking pictures. Fits into my pocket so it goes with me everywhere. So far, I am very satisfied with this camera.</Review>

The Canon S90 is an excellent pocketable camera I use when I can&apos;t carry my SLR with me. It has almost all of the adjustments I look for and they are so convenient to use through the two programmable dials. So easy to use, so small and such great pictures!</Review>

     <Review>I&apos;ve bought the case for underwater photography. I haven&apos;t used this specific one, but I&apos;ve used the case for Canon G10, which is more or less the same. Operating it under water is very easy, because the main buttons are located in reachable places. If you&apos;re trying to change some cmoplex functions set under the water - it&apos;s possible, but not too easy. Regarding depth - it&apos;s rated to 40 meters, which is more than the limit for NDL (regular SCUBA) dive. If you&apos;re planning to go Trimixing or on deeper dive, don&apos;t take it there or take it down to 40m and tie it there until (and if..) you&apos;re coming back. The nice thing about this case is that it can be used out of the water in places you&apos;re afraid to use your camera in - beach for example, due to the sand. The disadvantage is that you take a p ... retty small and handy camera like the S90, and you put it in a case that is quite big.

Cons: Short Battery Life

This is a great point and shoot. The only thing is, its almost to small. Though that is one of the reasons I picked it out. I am a semi-pro, that wanted to have a carry around every where that shot in RAW. This does it all, perfect for what I wanted it for, the only con it has, is the battery life SUCKS, Buy a couple of after market batteries to throw in your bag, your going to need them.</Review>

I like this camera very much. It&apos;s light weight and easy to use. I can carry it with me all the time and take the photos whenever I want and it has a good image quality, very clean and many choices to get a better picture. The only problem is that the picture seems a little yellow at night in door. I will purchase a DSRL camera later I think this one is a good choice before I have a DSRL one. I also bought another battery in case its short battery life. However, it can take about 200 photos with a fully charged battery. Usually that&apos;s enough for me.</Review>

     <Review>Pros: Quality of Picture, Speed of processing and Different Preset Modes.

Cons: Expensive, Little heavy.

I had a SONY DSC W180 before purchasing S90. The primary reason for switching the camera is the quality of picture and speed of processing. I would say this is one of the best camera for a person to know about photography. The quality of picture generated is really cool. I really liked the feature to generate the panoramic pictures (using software). Different presets provided in the camera are good for anybody who wants to learn to take good pictures. The camera also provides a way to adjust the aperture manually.

The camera provides a way to navigate the pictures through rolling button on top of the button click.

Overall I would say this is one great camera ... and I am very satisfied with this camera.

     <Review>The S90 is a small camera with big features. It is very user friendly and allows the user flexibiilty. Its small in size to take anywhere with similar features and quality of a SLR. Its the right balance between point and shoot and SLR.</Review>

     <Review>When I do not want to carry 4 pounds of DSLR around this is my camera. Image quality is very good but not large sensor quality. I have printed some images at 11x 14 and have been satisfied. It is a fun camera to use. There are some chromatic aberrations, the rear control dial is too easy to turn and battery life is not the best. Even with these few flaws I would purchase again.</Review>

     <Review>as many other people, I bought it based on the review from[@] I wanted a small portable camera with good quality. it was small, quality was good. I just couldn&apos;t stand the menus, and the lens, altough fast, seemed somehow not up to my expectations. ie, at manual mode, lens would go down to f4, but not higher than f9 if I am right. I was expecting full control from f4 to, say, f22. also, the lag time was just killing me. I returned it.</Review>

     <Review>Pros: Picture quality is top notch, low level light pictures possible without flash (low aperture), compact-take it everywhere

Cons: Back screen has a glare protectant coat that can show &quot;scratches&quot; very easily. Use a screen protector.

I have $4000 in professional SLR camera equipment and this camera takes pictures almost as good as the expensive stuff. It has limits that other camera doesn&apos;t have, but most of the pictures taken are equal in quality. Just beautiful pictures. Everyone who sees them is amazed.

I added Richard Franiec&apos;s custom grip to the front of it. Great addition to the camera. Makes it more easily operated with just one hand. And it keeps it safer and in my hand (not slipping out as easily). Just Google his name to find the grip. Great product. I am n ... ot affiliated, just love the product.

I also added a Lexerd screen protector to save the protective glare coating on the screen that &quot;scratches&quot; very easily. It isn&apos;t a true scratch in the screen (glass), but it takes on that appearance when that protective coating starts to get marred. I&apos;ve read other people just used a solvent to remove the coating. Either way the screen is beautiful and shows a great representation of your picture.

I also love the ease of the jog dial to scroll through the pictures. They transition by rolling across the screen. Pretty cool little effect that can be changed.

People have commented that the flash is in a &quot;bad&quot; place as it pops up right under where your left pointer finger usually would sit while taking a picture with two hands. I&apos;m not sure where else they would put the flash. And most people don&apos;t know this but the further the flash is away from the lens, the better your picture will come out (less red-eye too). So if it was embedded in the camera and didn&apos;t pop up, you get less quality pictures. Be happy it pops up. And because of the super low aperture (f/2.0) this camera can take pictures at, you&apos;ll be surprised how infrequently the flash actually does try to pop up and fire. Most of the pics
I take, even indoors at night, do not require the flash. Note - lower aperture means more light is being let in. And light is EVERYTHING in photography.

I really think this is the best compact Digital c ...

     <Review>Pros: Nice Build; High ISO; Accurate White Balance; Good Image Stabilization; Metal Body; Great Zoom; Good in Low Light; Nice Body Color; Short Lag Time; F20

Cons: Short Battery Life

This camera is good for both &quot;camera dummy&quot; and &quot;camera enthusiast&quot;. The auto mode takes cares of almost all of the business for &quot;camera dummies&quot;, the M, TV, AV modes are good for &quot;camera enthusiasts&quot;. It is small, and full of powerful functions. If you ever consider this camera, it means you are serious about the photo quality. You either go for S90 or DSLR, G11 is not an option because it is too heavy and too big to be a DC, and not powerful enough to be a DSLR.</Review>

     <Review>My first digital camera. Good pictures in low light, up to 800ISO. Good and bright lenses. Fit&apos;s in a pocket and the aperture ring is very fun. The battery is a bit short. Three days, 300 photos, barelly no flash and a recharge is needed. Overal a very nice camera!</Review>

     <Review>I can perfectly understand why some people are complaining about this camera. If you compare the quality of pictures produced by this camera with a cheaper (but still decent) P&amp;S, you will not see a lot of difference. Some cheaper cameras have greater zoom range and more traditional ergonomics (no pop-up flash, no freely moving dials, the shutter release button in a common place, etc.). If you are simply looking for a better camera to take family photos, don&apos;t buy this one, it was not specifically made for this purpose. This is a photographer&apos;s camera and its strength is the ability to fully control the picture taking process. If you only shoot in full auto mode, you will get the same quality pictures as many other P&amp;S cameras that cost significantly less. Photographers know exactl ... y why they are buying this little marvel. In fact, many of them have been waiting for a camera like that for years. As an amateur photographer, I can tell you this: I would still buy this camera even if it had no zoom at all (in fact, I&apos;d prefer it). Ergonomics could&apos;ve been a bit better though. All in all -- great photographer&apos;s camera (but they know it already). It may not be the best choice for everybody else, especially considering the price.

     <Review>I have had this camera for three weeks and carried it to DC with me last week. Great camera, fairly easy to use and even on auto or scene settings takes very good pictures while offering almost SLR creativity in a pocket size camera. RAW image capture is a plus. Very good in low light settings including indoors. Wish the camera had a bit more zoom range and battery life might be a problem but other than that its 5 stars.</Review>

     <Review>The fast lens, the effective auto ISO and the control ring and dial make this camera so easy for taking full control of creative photography...all in a pocket size camera. The addition of the low light feature, programmable button and great menus complete its versatility and ease of use. Everything I have always wanted in a pocket sized camera. The quality of the images is fantastic. Even at &gt;800 ISO the quality is still very good with little noise. The low light feature where it pushes the ISO to the extreme and reduces the noise by reducing the number of image pixels is brilliant.</Review>

     <Review>I indicate this camera to all photographers who want to have control over their pocket cameras. Nice slow mode with flash, f/stop 8.0 gives sharp images, easy to use controls at manual mode. The only problem is with high ISO. ISO is ok until 400. At 800 or higher better use jpeg mode, RAW images get a lot of noise which is difficult to reduce. Picture quality is good. But the big pro is that you have a very thin and compact camera which allows you to control everything manually. Congratulations to Canon. Finally someone made a digital compact cameras for photographers. I would compare this camera to the famous leica minilux. I think it will change the future of compact cameras.</Review>

     <Review>Pros: Easy To Use; Good in Low Light; Small / Compact

Cons: Bad telezoom end F49; Poor Image Quality

When i&apos;m on a trip and don&apos;t feel like dragging my gears around. This fits nicely into my jeans pocket. The only thing i hate about it is the colour reproduction... i wish canon won&apos;t smoothen out the picture and turn skin tone pale as much as they are doing now... else this would almost be the perfect P&amp;S.</Review>

     <Review>Pros: Fantastic photos from a small camera

Cons: NA

I was actually looking to purchase a new D-SLR when my Olympus point and shoot stopped working. I had read about the S90 a little while back and it sounded quite promising, After further research I decided it would be the perfect camera to replace my p&amp;s (sadly, my new D-SLR would have to wait).

So far I&apos;ve had the camera for about a month and it&apos;s been an absolute joy to use. The controls are easy enough to use and the ring is a great idea, it feels like a SLR although smaller. The photo quality is amazing for something that can fit in your pocket, I always have a camera with me and this is the best one to have because of its size.

There are other great features like stitch assist and smile recognition, et ... c. but those can be found on other cameras. The reason anyone should by this camera over another is because of its size and picture quality. This camera is far superior to any camera in its class and is worth every penny.

     <Review>I heard good things about this camera from posts like these and from sites like kenrockwell. I bought it because of the fast 2.0 lens. I have mixed feelings about this camera. The flash is in the wrong place. Who holds the camera with only the right hand? The shutter button is also in the wrong place. Two circular areas are at the top edge of the camera. The spot where the shutter button is supposed to be is where the options button is. I press and no picture is taken, then I have to slide my finger to the left to find the actual button. I am sure I would get used to this horrible ergonomic failing, but I usually use my DSLR and this camera is my &apos;always be available&apos; camera.The image quality is not a quantum jump up from my older P&amp;S Canon. For [$], the S90 is pricey. The other surpri ... se is the picture on the camera&apos;s LCD looks much better then how the picture appears on my computers.I am still undecided about returning the camera or not to return it. I am leaning to returning it since my older Canon is a 3X optical zoom, and I plan on buying the new Canon SX210 IS with its greater 14x zoom. Yes, I will lose the fast lense, but I will get the longer 14x zoom.Overall, it really did not live up to the hype for me.

     <Review>Pros: Easy To Use, Excellent picture quality, Excels In Low Light, Fast f2 Lens, Good Image Stabilization, Large Clear LCD, Small / Compact ... Cons: No Flash Hotshoe, No Molded Grip On Camera, No Viewfinder, Short Battery Life It&apos;s almost like having a mini DSLR in your pocket. Excellent full controls for those that like to shoot in manual, aperture, and shutter priority modes. I highly recommend adding a 3rd party grip that will improve the ergonomics of the camera. Just do a Google search for &quot;Nikon S90 grip&quot; and you&apos;ll find links to it. Having a second battery is a must when on extended outings. This camera also makes a great backup if you travel with your DSLR.</Review>
