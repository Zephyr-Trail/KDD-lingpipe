     <Review>Pros: Extremely comfortable, nice looks, good build, solid case, noise cancellation

Cons: Average sound quality, price, do not work with battery, flimsy cord

These are good, but not great headphones that cost $300. For $300, you could buy a PS3, a nice GPS, a surround sound system, or a small TV... so, I expected to get a nice piece of equipment for $300. For the most part, I was wrong... Here is what you get:

A good looking set of headphones that look and feel great. They are of great build quality, and extremely comfortable. The leather on the ear pads is super soft, almost luxurious. However, the cord is very thin and cheap looking. They fit snugly around my ears, so little ambient noise was able to enter. The noise cancellation feature worked pretty well with ambie ... nt noise such as jet engines. However, they don&apos;t cancel out random noise as well, such as people talking close by or load music. My Shure earbuds work better at blocking out that kind of noise. Also, the headphones don&apos;t work unless you have the noise cancelation switch on, which requires a battery (better have a spare on hand!). Overall, if you want these to block noise, I would recommend them. (Although $1 foam earplugs could do the same).

The most disappointing thing about these headphones was the sound quality. For $300, I could buy some great sounding speakers. However, great sounding is not what you get. They do have a good amount of bass; however, the bass is muddy and slow. There are also very poor highs. The treble clarity with music and voice is very poor in my opinion. It sounds like you are listening through a tin can. The mids are average, but not noteworthy. Overall, the sound produced by these headphones is average at best. My $100 Shure earbuds sound better in my opinion.

In conclusion, if you are looking for a comfortable pair of headphones to block out noise in a car or airplane, and don&apos;t care much about sound quality, these would work well for you. But, I still think you could do better for $300. For you audiophiles out there, trust me when I say &quot;don&apos;t buy these!&quot;. You definitely do not get your monies worth. I guess what they say i ...

     <Review>Pros: Light weight, has it&apos;s own formed case, BLOCKS OUT THE NOISE!

Cons: A little pricy, case a little bulky, have to sleep with head straight if you have them on.

I was facing a 19 and a half hour trip to Shanghai, China! Although I was flying first class, I wanted some sort of noise reducing headphones. I read about Sennheiser, Dr. Dre, and some others. EVERY review kept bringing me back to the Bose QC15. The Sennheiser headphones were wireless ( which is what I wanted) but, you had to be near the receiver ! Well, the receiver was going to be packed!! Also, Sennheiser design allowed noise to be filtered through openings for breathability?!!! That would ALLOW NOISE! NO!! Dr. Dre, was just trendy and still didn&apos;t completely block out noise, according to reviews. There were r ... eviews re: the Bose QC15 that said that they were too &quot;bassy&quot; and/or not audio superior for sound quality, but did block out airplane noise. Well, I found them extremely superior in sound quality while watching videos and TV, the bass/ treble levels were extremely well balanced. No hissing or popping; smooth like melted chocolate. And OMG! I slept like a dead person on the plane! I didn&apos;t even realize that there was a crying baby in the &quot;Elite&quot; section until I took off the headphones!!! Those suckers REALLY BLOCKED OUT THE NOISE!! I couldn&apos;t even hear the flight attendant talking to me if I didn&apos;t remove them. AND he was leaning down really close to me!! WOW!!! THANK YOU, Bose!!!
The headphones come with two different types of plugin cords; one for Apple devices, with a volume control, and a regular cord for a PC. It also comes with a jack adapter for airplane use. The case has formed inserts to cushion the headphones and keep them from being crushed inside of your luggage. Again, THESE ARE NOT WIRELESS! You have to plug them into your IPad, or IPHONE, Mac, or IPOD touch, or PC.
But you know what? They more than delivered the two MOST IMPORTANT requirements: true noise reduction AND SUPERIOR audio quality!!!
I decided to go back to Best Buy and get a pair for my hubby&apos;s birthday, who was waiting for me in Shanghai. :-)
I made a GREAT decision on the Bose QC ...

     <Review>Pros: Noise cancelling and sound

Cons: Can&apos;t listen to music w/o noise canceling

I have owned and still do have earbuds and headphones from many companies but I actually needed good noise-canceling headphones.. I am not one to have a blind brand loyalty and I buy what&apos;s sounds good to me. I like my bass sweet and to be felt, but not to a degree that sounds like a dull, loud thud. But at the same time I like the highs to be crisp and sizzling with an overall sound that satisfies all my senses when you can hear all the instruments and the whole music as intended by the musicians. At first, I tried the brand new Klipsch Mode M-40 noise canceling headphones (Best Buy does not carry them) since I really like how the my Klipsch earbuds and headphones image one (Best Buy carries bot ... h) sound. I had to return the new Klipsch in two days and was very disappointed since they didn&apos;t produce the sound I liked, they were very heavy and extremely uncomfortable. They were expensive too $349. So I decided to give the Bose QuietComfort 15 a try after reading so many positive reviews of them. And yes, I found I was looking for. So far they have the best noise-canceling and it is very effective majority of the time. The only downside is you have to have that feature on all the time, when it is off you cannot listen to your music. The sound is great. The bass is just the way I like it, prominent, sweet, effective but not too overpowering. The highs are very clear and crisp with the mids being very clear. There was a roominess to the sounds. I tried different genres, different quality of music ranging from 160 kbs to 320 kbs and sound reproduction was great. They are also very comfortable and surrounded my ears softly. The cushions are very soft and comfortable. The looks of these are probably are not the best in the market but I myself do not care about the looks. They fold flat by rotating the ear cups and came with a fairly decent zippered bag for storage. For $299 they are a best buy from Best Buy and I would highly recommend them if your sound tastes are like mi ...

     <Review>Pros: crystal clear sound

Cons: the price, the bass, the volume

OK I am an avid music listener of all different genres. The quality of the sound is AMAZING, definitely a crystal clear , and the noise cancelling is great for when I want to block the rest of the world out. However, if you are the kind of person who likes to feel the music as well as hear it, these headphones are not for you. despite the crystal clear sound, these headphones lack bass, which in my opinion allows you to really get the feel of the music. along with minimal bass, these also lack volume. I have to turn my ipod nearly all the way up to get the sound to my liking. I also have a pair of beats by dre. The beats are high in bass and volume but you don&apos;t get the clarity that the bose give you. So like I s ... aid, it all just depends on the music you like. If you like country, classical, or acoustic music, these headphones will keep you satisfied. But, If you like Hip-hop, dupstep, or rock, you may want to look elsewhere.

     <Review>Pros: Sound quality, noise reduction, comfort, size, case

Cons: $300 is a lot for anything, but its worth it

I had been looking for a new pair of headphones to replace my older Bose ones, and I was torn between the Bose QC15s and the Dr. Dre Beats Studios. After months of research I finally decided that I would purchase the Bose headphones. This was a fantastic idea. Although the Beats are nice, the QC15s blow them out of the water. The headphones have amazing noise canceling abilities and also crystal clear sound quality. Yes, the bass is not as nice as it is on the Beats, but these headphones still have very clear bass. The overall sound quality is stunning with perfectly blended sounds and well rounded highs and lows. The treble on these headphones is very clear as well. A ... side from the music, the noise canceling is wonderful. There are two settings, hi and lo. These can be adjusted from a small switch on the base of the detachable cord. TIP: FOR BETTER NOISE CANCELING SELECT HI, FOR BETTER SOUND QUALITY SELECT LO. The noise cancellation feels like it literally sucks the noise out of your environment. What actually occurs is microphones on the outside of the headphones pick up exterior noise frequencies, and the headphones play (this process is silent of course) the opposite frequency to cancel out the exterior distraction. But, the user will still be able to hear faint human voice if they are close, and this is for safety purposes. Another advantage is that the cord from the headphones can be removed, so if the cord breaks, you do not have to buy another pair of $300 headphones. Also, the QC15s come with 2 chords, both work the same, but one specializes in ipods/ipads/iphones (it has an Apple control bar). I use the headphones with my Motorola Droid X and I have had only positive experiences throughout my usage. The headphones also come with an airplane adapter for travel, a very nice Bose carrying case, and 1 AAA battery, which the headphones run on. All together, these headphones are a great investment, and are worth every penny of the $300 that they cost.

     <Review>Little background on me. I am not an audiophile, but I consider myself wise enough to recognize what sounds good through a headphone and I listen to ALL kinds of music. I have had beats studio headphones since Christmas and have flown a few times with them. They sound decent and have good bass. Noise cancellation was good, but the worst thing was they leaked sound bad even at middle volume levels. I put up with it for awhile, but good too annoying to people around me who could hear every lyric. Plus they are a little clunky in size.

I finally decided this week to grab the Bose QC 15 to compare. And WOW! It is a night and day different sound. Bose was much more balanced when I played all types of music. I kept my iphone on one song at constant volume and switched back and forth betwe ... en each headphone. There was no doubt I would be keeping the Bose. The Beats sounded &quot;muffled&quot; like there was a blanket over the speaker. Bose was clear and good tone on all levels. I let my friends compare blindly and they agreed also. And of course the noise cancellation was awesome. Comfort is amazing also. Beats had a lil too heavy feel, and you could hear the parts moving when you move your head ( hard to explain unless you have tried them)

Bose case is much flatter, it only takes one AAA battery (included). Beats had a bulky case and took 2 batteries. These Bose should be much easier to store in my backpack now, and comes with 2 cables (regular and one w/inline remote) similar to the beats. For the same price I would pick the Bose 100% of the time over the Beats. Plus I felt personally a lil too old to have those hip-hop style. Loved the navy blue color, but will be selling the Beats now.

     <ReviewTitle>Closest thing to perfection</ReviewTitle>

     <Review>Pros: everything thats included is top quality.

Cons: nothing at all

During this review i will be comparing these to the beats studio headphones by dr. Dre, since they are in the same price range and are constantly compared to by many people. I will start with the worst part(trust me its acctually much better than it sounds) the durability. These have a replacable audio cable, and earpads, making these an very easy to replace broken parts. I still have only one problem with these bose headphones, and thats the thin headband. It seems flimsy but after 6 months these haven&apos;t even scratched. i wrote a review on the beats, but it is way off of durability, i wrote it only a month after i had them, and a month later they snapped into three peices, the two acctual headphones broke o ... ff from the headband, making those the worst pair of 300 dollar headphones i have ever bought. Its pretty even in comfort compared to the beats, little to say here. Ill talk about leaking sound next. THe beats leak sound HORRIBLY, i mean for less money skullcandy can make headphones that dont leak sound, now thats just sad when skullcandy can outpreform you. These dont leak any sound making these perfect for airplane rides. Oh and i almost forgot the noise canceling feature. these take two AA batteries so you can bring an extra pair around, and they cancel out all the sound(the beats do this too but dont cancel out as much sound). Your ears will be put to the test of how sensitive they are, these cancel out everything but your music, im not even kidding. Sound quality wise, these are as close to perfection as anything, with perfectly clear highs, lows , and mids. and for those of you wondering, the bass is just right and isnt overpowering, but the bass isnt as powerful as the beats, but these offer perfectly balanced sound, so get these if you listen to all types of music like me. Bose has now reset the bar, and it is as close to perfection as anything i have seen yet(for portable use anyways) and you can tell that bose used there many years of experiance and res ...

     <Review>Pros: Sound quality and noise cancelling are incredible.

Cons: Price is a little steep

I travel quite a bit and wanted some headphones that would provide good sound for my music and movies and at the same time cancel some of the noise. I first bought the Phillips O&apos;Neil headphones and they were good. Much better value for the product. I went to buy a pair for my wife for her birthday and they didn&apos;t carry them any longer. I bought the Bose QC 15 instead. I had been researching several products since I bought the Phillips set. Listening to the headphones in the store, I settled on the Bose because they were the same price as the Beats, but they appeared to be significantly better at noise canceling. Plus I figured if my wife didn&apos;t really like them or wanted to trade that woul ... d be okay with me. :D

We tried the headphones on a recent trip and it&apos;s easy to see (or should I say hear) why Bose is a leader in the market. When you activate the noise canceling it blocks out the majority of noise around you. When you add a little music or movie to it, you cannot hear anything around you; including engine noise on the plane. They really are that good.

These headphones come with a hard type carrying case and the ears fold in flat to make it easier to fit in your carry on luggage or computer bag. They also come with two different plugs. One has a microphone to use with your i-Products. Very convenient for Facetime with the family. Just remember the people around you at Starbucks can hear you even though you cannot hear them. (embarrassed myself a little. :) )

The headphones fit great. I have actually fallen asleep wearing them and did not have any discomfort when I woke up and realized I still had them on.

The sound quality is incredible. You can hear every syllable enunciated. The Beats have better low bass, but unless you just want to thump all of the time the Bose have a better overall sound quality in my opinion.

They are quite expensive. That didn&apos;t stop me from buying myself a set when I realized my wife was not going to give up hers or even consider t ...

     <Review>Pros: The fit and weight

I have tried various noise canceling headphones over the years. I currently own both these Bose Quiet Comfort 15 and the Monster Beats by Dr. Dre headphones. The Bose version are my favorites. While the bass response on the Monster Beats is better, overall I much prefer the Bose Quiet Comfort 15 headphones. They are lightweight, fit over my ears well, and provide good sound fidelity. I wear glasses and these headphones do not bother me, even during extended wear sessions (I just returned from a trip to Sri Lanka where I wore the headphones almost continuously on the ~22 hours of flight one-way). They come with a nice carrying/travel case. The audio cable detached from the headphones; should it become damaged, you can purchase the cable separately without hav ... ing to buy a new headset!

     <Review>Pros: comfort, noise cancellation, durability

Cons: price, style

i have been debating over beats studio and bose qc15. i bought both to try them out, and bose is best. they sound amazing, there extremely comfortable, durable, and dont leak sound like the beats. you cannot beat the active noise cancellation, it is the best. the mids and highs are great, and the bass as well. there is only one word to describe them, incredible. if you are debating over these and beats, it comes down to style and sound leakage or good noise cancelation and incredible comfort and durability.</Review>

     <Review>I&apos;m going to college this fall, and I need a pair of noise-cancelling headphones. First of all, I don&apos;t want to annoy my roommates by turning my laptop&apos;s speakers on. Second, I really care about sound quality when it comes to music. Third, I hate wearing earphones because they aren&apos;t comfortable. I spent time researching good noise-cancelling headphones. It took me a while to decide whether to buy Bose QC 15 or Dr.Beats Studio. Finally, I chose Bose because of its great sound quality, reputation, and noise-cancelling system. Things that are great about it: good noise-cancelling, nice design, very comfortable, and good bass. Things that aren&apos;t so great: battery life is kinda short.</Review>

     <Review>Pros: Quality, The Perfect Headphones

Cons: The price is a little steep.

I&apos;m very picky about sound quality and these are perfect in my opinion. Exactly what I was looking for, these are one of the very few sets of headphones out there that will match (or beat) the sound of a good set of speakers/surround sound. I took awhile to look at some of the other headphones in the price range, hoping to maybe find some just as good for a little cheaper, but found none. Dr. Dre&apos;s headphones have a lot of bass, but its took much and doesn&apos;t sound good, it gets that vibrating booming bass. Not these though, perfect bass, plenty of boom but its the perfect sound, not too much.

Vocals sound amazing on these, much easier to hear, perfectly crisp and clear. I find myself enjoying acou ... stic songs on these headphones just because they sound so good.

Comfort is perfect on these, usually I can&apos;t listen to headphones for too long because they start to get annoying. Not these, I found myself wearing these for over 8 hours the other night when I was caught up in a work project. After all that the only thing was they were a little warm on my ears because they completely cover them.

Theres a Hi/Lo volume switch on the cord that goes inside the headphone and hides away nicely. This is good for times when you don&apos;t want the volume to go too loud. When on the Hi setting they do go very loud, sometimes you get those headphones that just don&apos;t go loud enough and they can be really annoying.

Although with these you don&apos;t really need to crank up the volume, the noise canceling on these is amazing. Just put them on your head and before you put on any music turn them on, as soon as it clicks in you can just hear the difference. They block everything out, even sounds that you didn&apos;t realize were there like the fan on your computer. You&apos;re in your own little audio world.

My only two complaints are very minimal. For one, the battery doesn&apos;t last that long in my opinion, although I do use them a lot. I&apos;ve had them for about a 6 weeks and I&apos;ve changed the battery twice. I ...

     <Review>Pros: Comfort and sound deadening.

Cons: Price.

I purchased Sennheiser PXC-250 for me and the next year PXC-350 for my wife. Those are on-the-year style with a battery unit corded to the headset. These proved to be very uncomfortable and cumbersome with the cord and battery pack. I then purchased a QC15 for myself and they are SO much more comfortable with the over-the-ear design and NO battery pack. NO cord is required for just noise cancelling. You only plug in a cord for listening to music from whatever source. Not only that, they come with TWO cords. The second cord has a built-in microphone for use with devices like iPhone, iPad, or Androids that accept that type of connection. Perfect for Skyping.</Review>

     <Review>Pros: Detail sound

Cons: Might be flimsy

Bought this item as a gift for my brother&apos;s 50th birthday. Was deciding between these and pair of Beats for the same price. I ultimately choose these because they were lighter and I believe will be more comfortable for long term use. Also clarity at the high end seemed better them Beats although the Beats had more bass. I thought the noise canelling function would be especially heplfull on the train by reducing but certainly not eliminating backround noise.</Review>

     <Review>Fit over ears, not smashing or binding them. Soft cushions. Silent when off, great sound when on. Got them for my husband who flies and he loves them. Cheap knockoffs that list for the same price are nothing close in headband comfort, build quality, ear cups, weight, compactness, sound, or quietness. They&apos;re worth it.</Review>

     <Review>Got the QC15s, they have great sound quality and noise cancelling. I listen to them when studying and on the go, and they are awesome! The price has made itself back just from the increased productivity I have received from the noise cancelling. They have an expensive feel, a detachable cable, and the LED tells you when you need to change the battery. They come with a nice case and an extra cable. I would suggest them for classical, rock, and pop music, but if you&apos;re looking for exaggerated bass, this isn&apos;t the right product. The sound quality is more refined and lifelike. I would definitely recommend this for travellers; they make a dramatic difference in cancelling out noise. Plus, if you&apos;re an MIT student, discount on all Bose products</Review>

     <Review>Pros: Noise canceling!!! It&apos;s comfortable and light.

Cons: Price... I&apos;ve heard couple better sounding headphones... They look like $35 headphones...

I have these headphones for couple months now so I believe, I have the knowledge to review them.

First of all, they look cheap, at least a lot cheaper than they really are. But it doesn&apos;t matter once you put them on your head (and turn them on...?#
Let me begin with noise cancelling funcion since they&apos;ve been made specificly for that feature. I must say, it&apos;s working more than great. I use them daily in my work and I want to point out that I have a horibly loud vacuum cleaner. I was kinda afraid that even these headphones would not give me enough noise cancelation to cut off that monster. Surprisingly, they did! I have ... another Bose headphones and I also use Zune for listening music. Previously, I needed to have the volume on 24/31 level to cut off #a little# my vacuum cleaner. Now I use 17/31 and I can hear a thing. Well, maybe a little quiet shhhhhh... However, I need to add that I wear glasses and I have to take them off in order to get the full noise canceling effect.
Let&apos;s get to the sound. It&apos;s nice. The headphones are not perfectly flat #the bass is a little louder and the middle-low quiter# but they bring out every detail which I really like. However, I&apos;ve heard better sounding headphones like Shure SRH840 that are more flat #studio headphones#.
Concluding, Bose® QuietComfort® 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling® Headphones are good enough to excuse $300 price. They really look and feel like $35 headphones but they are comfortable #even with glasses on#, they sound almost perfect and the noise cancelling works better than you could expect.

P.S. You should buy some batteries #rechargable) to use them. However, the battery life is good enough - 2-3 weeks of daily use for like 3 hours.

     <Review>Pros: The sound, and the fit.

Cons: Some of the features not included.

Most here have reviewed this product as being great except for the price. I&apos;ll be doing the same here. The sound is imaculate, and the wave length and ranges are perfect. The one issue I had with this product is that you can&apos;t use it without the noise cancelling. I use mine about 5-6 hours per day, and don&apos;t always need the noise cancelling aspect of the phones as it hurts my head a bit after about 4 hours. I also would like to point out that the battery runs out for me about every month or so, so that&apos;s not great.

All in all, I think they are great headphones, that still need improvement.

PS. The iPhone cord is amazing, and an awesome idea!</Review>

     <Review>Pros: great sound, noise reduction and fit

Cons: same price as QC2, but still pricey nonetheless.

I have owned the QC2 headphones from Bose for many years and primarily use them during air travel. I travel frequently - and I loved them. I didn&apos;t think there could be much improvement over them, so I didn&apos;t see a need to buy another set of headphones. However, my reluctance to purchase quickly changed when I tried a pair on and listened to difference in the sound / music and most importantly for me, the noise reduction. Its amazing how well these headphones work, and they are a bit slimmer and lighter than the QC2s. The case is slimmer too.</Review>

     <Review>Pros: fit, noise cancelling technology, sound quality, Bose Customer Support

Cons: None that I&apos;ve found thus far.

I received these as a gift in November 2011. I use them several times a week with my PC. The fit is fantastic, they feel great on. The noise cancelling works superbly and the sound is top-notch. A little high-priced, but certainly a good product.

I had to call Bose Customer Support today because I was experiencing an problem with the head phones, there was a popping sound then the volume would drop out completely. I was irritated that such expensive headphones would break so soon, but in talking with the Customer Support person, he suggested I make sure the cord was properly seated in the headphones, and to check the battery. Turns out it was just needing a ... new battery. Thumbs up for the Bose QuietComfort 15 headphones and thumbs up for the Bose Customer Support.

     <Review>Pros: Bass balanced well with sound quality.

Cons: The cord seems a little flimsy.

I have been a audiophile for years and these are without a doubt the best sounding headphones I&apos;ve ever had the pleasure of listening to. I compared these to the Dre beats in the same price range and the Bose blow them away. You have to get the $500 beats to compare. I work in a noisy factory and the noise canceling is excellent. I listen to many types of music and these sound great with all of them. Lots of bass without sacrificing sound quality and clarity. I&apos;d recommend these to anyone willing to spend the coin on $300 headphones.</Review>

     <Review>Pros: comfort, noise cancelling, sound quality.

Cons: Not as much bass as the QC 3.

Just purchased the Bose QC 15 headphones. Very impressed with the design, the noise cancelling effect, the sound (not as bassy as the QC 3) but very clear sound quality. They are lightweight, very comfortable and the extra cable which allows pause, rewind/next track, volume up/down is brilliant. Very happy with the purchase.</Review>

     <Review>Pros: Noise cancelling for travel.

Cons: You have to remember to turn them off. No auto off

I fly at least two times a month and am on flights that are over 4 hours each way at least every other month. I like to watch movies on my IPAD and with the plane noise from the engines, it can be very difficult to hear with the earbuds that came with it. I have tried a couple other kind of earbuds and they weren&apos;t much better.

My biggest drawbacks from buying these were the price and also the size (I always pack a lot in my backpack and didn&apos;t want headphones taking up any more room). The headphones fold and the carrying case doesn&apos;t take up much room and it is nice for protecting the headphones as well as to to keep a spare battery in the zipper compartment along with the airl ... ine adapter jack.

I was amazed at the quality when I flew yesterday. With the earbuds, a lot of times I would have to have the volume up all the way on my ipad as well as pressing the earbuds in with my finger to help keep out noise from the plane engines. I was able to keep the volume down and hear the sound fine. I wanted to take a nap in the last part of the flight after the movie was over just left the headphones on and they did block most of the outside noise. I have trouble sleeping on planes, not only due to engine noise, but from flight announcements and hearing people nearby talkign and hearing people pass me when they are going to the lav. This blocked out all those noises and I didn&apos;t even hear the pilots or FA&apos;s announcement to discontinue the use of electronics and didn&apos;t realize it until the FA tapped me on the shoulder asking me to stow them, apparently on some airlines they treat them the same as electronics even though they are not being used with any other device, so that can be a drawback if you want them for noise cancelling the entire fligght.

     <Review>Pros: Sound quality, comfort, lightweight, comes with a nice case, durable.

Cons: Thus far? None.

I debated between the Dre beats and these QC15&apos;s for over a week. After much debating, I determined that the noise canceling and audio responsiveness of the BOSE can&apos;t be beat. I am BLOWN away by how much it cuts out. Literally isolates you, close your eyes, and be taken away to another place. No outside distractions. The bass, though people complain isnt enough, is VERY precise. I am impressed with the highs, mids, and lows. If you are looking for something that will cut outside noise, give you the audio response of higher quality headphones, and allow you to be COMFORTABLE while listening, Get these. I hated to part with the 300 bucks, but after the 12 hour international flight ... , they already paid for themselves.

Invest in a nice neckpillow, throw these on, and your music like you never have before.

Worth the investment. =)

Cons: Price is high, but worth it for peace in the house!

I am sooooo excited about these! Already, I can tell that they are my fave purchase this year. Love the noise canceling and great audio quality. The leather is very soft. The cups fit my ears very nicely. I just turned on my &apos;white noise &apos; app on my iPad and I could NOT be more at peace or happier! I have a pair of Shure top- of-the-line. The sound is good but cannot compare to the comfort and noise reduction of Bose.</Review>

     <Review>Pros: Light, comfortable, sound quality, one AAA battery.

Cons: Cost

I had a pair of the Sony MDR-NC50 for 3 years. They still worked ok but I wanted something lighter and louder. I purchased the newer Sony MDR-NC60 and returned them the same day. There was a loud pulsating thump in the right earpiece when the NC is activated. Others have had the same issue in the reviews. Listened to the Beats in the store and liked the build quality, but were too heavy and way too much bass for my taste. I bought the QC-15&apos;s and utter bliss! Light, just enough bass, crisp high&apos;s, one AAA battery to power a rechargeable will also work, they also can go much louder on my notebook and nano than my old Sony&apos;s. Try them for 30 days, return them if you don&apos;t like them. YOU WON&apos;T!</Review>

     <Review>Pros: Sound is crisp and clear.

Cons: Requires one AAA battery.

My 13 year-old son bought these headphones with his lawn mowing money and would recommend them to anyone wanting to invest in a great pair of headphones. He has had them for several weeks now and they seem very durable, but he is being very careful with them. The AAA battery lasts a long time, but you&apos;ll want to keep an extra on hand if you&apos;re going on vacation. The noise cancelling feature is excellent. They come with a really nice hard storage case.</Review>

     <Review>Pros: Use with iPod Nano. Use at the gym and at home to greatly reduce surrounding noise from TV, etc.

Cons: Does not totally eliminate noise but greatly reduces it.

Even though the headphones fit over the ears and I felt like they looked more like headphones for a man, I don&apos;t feel conspicuous wearing them. The quality is excellent and wonderful for listening to music on my iPod Nano. Feel the price of the headphones was worth the price for what you get. Loved the sturdy, black case the headphones come with as well as the adaptor to use on most airlines.</Review>

     <Review>Pros: Sound quality and comfort

Cons: Low battery indicator

Out of other ear buds, surround sound stereos, and full aftermarket car audio systems, these headphones have the best sound quality I&apos;ve ever experienced. The bass is not overwhelming and I can hear subtle details in all kinds of music that I have never noticed before.
For those curious about the &quot;noise cancellation&quot; the headphones do not block out all ambient sound, but what they do is silence subtle background noises like air conditioning hum, refrigerator compressors, etc. And the only way you will hear anything through them is by turning them on, and there is no ability to play music without the noise cancellation turned on. The level of noise cancellation is adjustable on the plug that goes into the headphone ... s themselves but there is no way to make adjustments if you are wearing them without either of the headphone cables plugged into them.
I&apos;m a medical student and primarily use them to listen to podcasts of lectures and by themselves during tests to help decrease ambient noise. With all that being said they are extremely comfortable and seem very sturdy and well built.
My only real complaint is the low battery indicator. There is a small green light above the on/off switch on the right headphone which tells you the headphones are turned on. When the battery begins to get low the light will start to blink green and the only way to know this is to take the headphones off and look. So you really only know the batteries are almost going to die if the sound or noise cancellation cuts out while you are listening to them. I go about 5-7 days between having to change out the batteries.

     <Review>Pros: Great Quality, Awesome Sound

Spending a lot of time on aircraft I was looking for something to drown out the sound. The QC series does just that. My last 2hr trip on a C-130 military aircraft was somewhat nice due to these headphones.

This product comes with a case for extra protection. Extra cables, batteries and an iPOD fit great. There is also the option of using these in General Aviation aircraft. The &quot;uflymike&quot; can be installed for use in 2 prong aviation radios with the option of attaching a cell phone or MP3 player. I use this combo in prop fixed wing aircraft with no issues.

The sound is excellent, full base and crisp treble with defining mids. Most output will not blow out the speakers over time. The leather ear pad is comfortable and does not cause you ... to sweat. Overall amazing quality, you get what you pay for but well worth it in the end.

     <Review>Pros: Noise Cancelling

Cons: Bass Quality

Buy these headphones for what they are - noise canceling headphones. If you want superior bass sound quality, do your research and consider other options. As far as noise canceling over ear headphones go, these are the best on the market. I considered buying these for quite a while and did as much research as possible (I didn&apos;t find a ton of online reviews for noise cancelling headphones). I am a little upset about the lack of bass, but the other benefits outweigh that cost. I travel frequently on long flights and the noise cancelling is great and you can use the noise cancelling without music if you just want it more quiet so you can sleep. With the exception of slightly lower bass quality, all other audio quality is great and they a ... re very comfortable.

Cons: The price

I love these headphones!! I also have another set of Bose headphones, but, these are much better than my other set. The sound quality is fantastic and the headphones fit great, so, there is NO outside noise....the only thing you hear is your music. They are expensive, but, I am so glad that I bought them. The only suggestion I would have is for Bose to make their products a little more affordable. Other than that, you won&apos;t be sorry that you buy them.</Review>

     <Review>Pros: Comfort and light weight

Cons: PRICE

I tried almost every headphone avaible before choosinng the QuietComfort 15. They buy far the most comfortable that I tried, and the sound quality is very good. With the equalizer programs on most equipment, you can fine tune the sound to your taste. The first set I picked up had a blown right speaker, but no problem with the exchange at BestBuy. The second pair works perfectly. I feel these are over priced, but that is a Bose problem not BestBuy. Bose has national pricing, no discount anywhere. But that being said, these are the same price as this level oh headphones from all manufacturers.

Con: 1. Cord is very thin. This is great for travel, but I wouuld like to see a coiled cord also availble for home use.
2. Must have a ... battery for them to operate. This is no deal breaker as 1 AAA battery last 35 hours, so just carry spares when you travel. (I own a Hybrid car so I am kind of green)
3. The angle on the plug catches on my DVD drive on my computer. But, it is perfect for my iPhone 4. (Apple overrules again)

     <Review>Pros: Great noise reduction to block ambient jet roar and quality sound.

Cons: Ear cups hurt my ears on long flights. Price was too high!!

While these do a good job helping filter out jet engine noise, the pressure of the ear cups started hurting my ears after 2 hours into the flight, so that by the end of the 12 hour journey, I was painfully sore. They do offer a good listening experience for the in flight entertainment system, which is enhanced by the noise cancellation. But these headphones come with a heavy price tag, and the reason is probably because of the Bose reputation. These are good, but I think my previous brand of noise canceling headphones were just as good with sound and filtering but at a quarter of the price.</Review>

     <Review>Pros: Excellent noise reduction and sound quality!

Purchased this for my wife who flies in small commuter jet planes to different cities in the state of Texas. It was very difficult for her to hear sound from her tablet. After purchasing these for her, she is very content with their performance and has no problem hearing from her tablet. They almost entirely cancel out the jet engines.</Review>

Cons: bass is not as good as competition

My last set of Bose wore out, but still worked. There was no way to get replacement ear cups, and I swore I would never buy Bose again, but now they sell such a replacement kit. I primarily use these to cover the noise on airplane rides; it does that better than any other pair. The sound is clean and crisp.</Review>

     <Review>Pros: sound quality, noise cancellation, new musical discovery

Cons: flimsy cord

these headphones give you an amazing sound that will put you on a different planet. they give you everything from the highest highs to the deepest bass within the confounds of your skull.

i would recommend these headphones to anyone that has the money to invest in their perfect quality.

the noise cancellation is amazing but requires a AAA battery. although the battery life is exquisite, i would advise investing in rechargeable AAA batteries to have on hand at all times.

I&apos;ve only had one issue with these headphones and that is the cord. it is extremely thin and mine has ripped at the flex part on the plug in. it is replaceable and has yet to affect the sound but for this pric ... e, i would expect a bit higher quality cord.

overall. get these as soon as you can and use them for every type of music because you will hear things you never knew existed.

     <Review>Pros: Smaller than my old Boise set and much less outside noise.

Cons: To hear the music you have to turn on the sound reduction switch. It is battery operated.

It is a great headset for listening to your favorite music. The noise reduction switch does keep out 90% or more of the noise. The problem is forgetting to turn off the battery operated switch when you finish listening. The quality of sound is only produced by a Boise product. Love it but really don&apos;t like the switch. It should be on all the time due to when it is off that little or no sound comes out of the earphones.</Review>

     <Review>Pros: Unparalleled sound quality.

Cons: Too large, takes up too much space in briefcase

I travel a lot and purchased the headset for both noise cancelling features and sound quality. I was not disappointed. They fully cancelled the airplane engine noises. When playing music via my I Pad or IPhone the sound quality was outstanding. I&apos;ve used other headsets to watch movies on planes and sometimes dialogue is difficult to hear even when volume is on full. Didn&apos;t even get close with this headst. There was no engine or ambient noise that had to be overcome. Just pure sound. Music and dialogue were crisp and clear.

Two minor issues: 1) this headset fully covers your ears so they tend to get a little warm; and 2) this is a big headset. While it doesn&apos;t look large in the case, ... it takes up a lot of room in the briefcase.

     <Review>Pros: Pretty much everything.

Cons: Price

Got a pair of these at my local best buy and I gotta tell ya, this is one of the best noise cancelling headphones that I&apos;ve ever tried on in person. I got myself a Audio Technica ATH-ANC7B awhile ago and compare to the qc15, the qc15 are significantly better then the ATH-ANC7B (now I&apos;m not saying that audio technica is a bad company, I do owned them awhile back and they canceled out the outside noise pretty good). Sound quality is fantastic. They are very comfortable to wear on (I had this on for more then an hour and still no sign of discomfort). The bass on these are great (not as good as the dr.dre studios, but it will still do the job). The price range was a little pricey, but it&apos;s well worth every penny. Overall, if you want a hi ... gh-end noise cancelling headphones, this is the one to go with.

     <Review>Pros: Clarity

Cons: Must use AAA battery to listen. Once the battery goes dead, so does your headset.

Great sound and very comfortable around the noggin. I use daily, but the requirement to use a battery to listen is not so great. I use in my office for streaming music to drown out the busy bodies around me. Unfortunately, when I would like to hear over the music, the noise canceling (NC) works so well that I can&apos;t even hear the phone ring. I wish Bose would allow you to listen through the headset without the NC and make that feature optional. If I run out of AAA&apos;s, my sound is dead. - Just sayin!</Review>

     <Review>Pros: Noise Cancellation, style, sound quality, iPhone cord

Cons: Cords that are included tangle up easily, unlike Beats by Dr. Dre Studio&apos;s cords

Apart from being a Beats by Dr. Dre Studio fan for a few months now, I have been a Bose owner since late 2008, when I got my first pair of QC 2 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones. Since then I have owned 5 pairs of the QC 15s due to battery issues, so my warranty is virtually endless.

Apart from the battery issues, these headphones are currently the best out there that Bose makes. With a few enhancements to the noise cancellation, they could be better, but for now they&apos;re still the best.

Bose first came out with these cans in the summer of 2009. I got these for Christmas of 2009, and since then I have loved every pa ... ir that I&apos;ve gotten. The noise cancellation is so good both with and without plugging them into my iPhone, MacBook Pro, or iPod Touch that I can barely hear anybody else speaking.

Ideally with new enhancements Bose could make these cans literally completely noise cancelling. If I had to design and engineer these headphones I&apos;d keep the same design, but I&apos;d engineer these to the max in order to literally make sure that you cannot hear a thing. But that&apos;s my dream, and it&apos;ll probably never happen.

Anyway now back to the cans. The sound quality is excellent. The case is sturdy. The cans are comfortable. The only thing that annoys me is the cords that come with the cans. They can get tangled up super easily, unlike Beats by Dre&apos;s cords, which don&apos;t tangle at all. The iPhone cable is great in terms of the sound quality. When you are talking to someone it&apos;s almost like the Bose Bluetooth Headset. You and the other person can hear each other very well.

The bass on these cans is impressive. Now they&apos;re not up to par with the Beats by Dr. Dre Studios that I own, but they&apos;re still great in terms of the audio quality.

If you&apos;re looking for a good pair of noise cancelling headphones for going on a trip by plain, train, car, boat, or bus, then the Bose QC 15s are your best bet. They&apos;re the best that Bose has to offer until a newer model is announced, which is ...

     <Review>Pros: Sound isolation technology

Cons: Price

I am not an audiophile, but I do like hearing music the way it is meant to sound. When I went shopping for home theater speakers I tried a bunch of different brands, including Bose, and eventually went a different direction because Bose did not produce the best sound quality. Having said that, the sound from the QC-15s is very good, and was not the main selling point for me. I was looking for something with great sound isolation, and having tried a few other brands, there really is no comparison - the Bose rocks! Some of the other brands had slightly better sound quality, but they paled in comparison to the Bose in their noise cancellation technology. The slight offset in sound quality was not worth it to me, so I went with the Bos ... e and am very happy I did. I can mow my lawn with these things on and the lawnmower is a dull hum in the background. Airplane noise is non-existent when I have them on.

     <Review>Pros: Rich music, voice and sound FX...and awesome noise reduction

Cons: Warm on the ears for extended periods

I use these headphones everyday for a variety of reasons. Often it is to listen to music, but a lot of time is spent listening to voice-over work to edit. These headphones are very comfortable to wear for extended periods of time, and I wear glasses so the fact they fit over the ear is very important. The only comfort note I would add is they are warm. If you are going to wear them for more than 20-30 minutes you may find your ears getting quite warm. The noise cancelling operations of the headphones is truly incredible. You put them on, turn them on and the outside world melts away. While I haven&apos;t flown with them yet, I have used them at work to reduce distractions ... . Listening to music or gaming sound FX is a real treat with these headphones. Everything is so clear and the lows are unbelievable. I have wanted a set of these for years and was so excited to receive them as a gift for Christmas this year. The fact that it comes with a cable that allows iPhone interface is a nice feature. They are, in my opinion definitely worth the price.

     <Review>Pros: The sound, Bass, Clarity, Comfort, Noise cancelling

Cons: Still 300$ but worth it

Ive always loved bose for their quality, comfort, and durability. Before i bought these i had a pair of the over ear bose (non noise cancelling) those lasted me 4 years and even now they work pretty well. If your comparing these to the Beats I would choose these for the reason that 1. The Beats are more prone to breaking due to the plastic head piece 2 I think these are more comfortable 3 the noise cancelling in these is unmatched. I hope this will help anyone&apos;s decision before buying a set of headphones like these. Also it helps to go to your local BestBuy and sample both these headohones and make your own comparison.</Review>

     <Review>Pros: Noise reduction and sound quality

Cons: Price

This is a great headset. The noise reduction feature is amazing and the sound is typical Bose high quality. The only con is the price. It is a little high, but you get what you pay for.</Review>

     <Review>Pros: Good Value, Noise Cancellation, Bose Sound, iPhone compatible

Cons: No quarter inch connector

I bought these after returning a disappointing set of Monster Beats by Dr Dre Pro Special Edition Detox headphones which I had purchased for $499. By comparison, these are certainly an excellent value for the price. At $200 less than the Beats - these headphones outperformed the Beats in every way that I can think of except one. The Beats came with a mini to quarter-inch adapter and the QC15&apos;s don&apos;t include this. The QC&apos;s come with an additional iPhone cord (with a mic) which is nice to have.

The sound quality is good. One is that I noticed that these headphones sound best at higher volumes. At the higher volumes - the sound quality is thilling and encouraged me to spend ... much time under these headphones - wanting to hear things that I haven&apos;t listened to in years just to hear them through these phones. Look, we all know what the Bose sound is - and these are Bose sound plus better mids than Bose sound. if you like the Bose sound #and I do# you&apos;ll love these phones.

At lower volumes, there is nothing to really complain about - but they didn&apos;t thrill they same as they do at the higher volumes. To my ear, this is true of many Bose products so I kind of expected this. I could be wrong but there were a couple of moments that I thought that I could detect a little bit of the noise cancellation bleed through for a brief instant during a very quiet part of a song. I can&apos;t be sure - and there&apos;s little way to know as you can&apos;t turn the noise cancellation off as far as I know. Even if this were true - the sound was still extremely good but these are the only reasons that I didn&apos;t go to excellent.

Also - I should note that this is my first set of noise cancelling headphones. The noise cancellation is nothing short of amazing. If all you want is a little quiet, you don&apos;t even need to plug in the phones to any audio source - just put on the phones and turn them on. I can&apos;t wait for my next flight.

I wavered between good and excellent on Comfort. These headphones are light and ...

     <Review>I purchased these to ease the discomfort of a 16 hour flight from Newark to Hong Kong. Little did I know what I&apos;ve been missing all along. There are a few things you should know

1) The main reason I bought these was for noise cancellation and wow it does not disappoint. In fact, the noise cancellation is so good it feels almost like sensory deprivation experiment in the military, unless you turn some music on. Your brain is used to hearing ambient noise so when you put these on and turn the switch on without any input, it&apos;ll feel like you just lost your hearing. This works great on a long haul airline flight.

2) The sound quality is really good. MAybe I have never used good headphones but the quality is really good.

3) It uses a AAA battery to operate. Now, I had no in ... dication how long it would last so I brought four with me on my trip. I think after almost 10 hours of usage, I was still on the first battery. I was impressed. But you know, it&apos;s easy to bring a few batteries just to be safe.

4) These completely drown out the sound of the aircraft. Rather than listening to a loud whooshing sound for 16 hours, I had sweet silence.

BUY THEM!!!

     <Review>Pros: Sound quality, comfort, durablity, worth every penny...HANDS DOWN!

Cons: $300 for headphones :/

I have had my Bose QC15&apos;s for about two years and I couldn&apos;t be happier with them. After going through numerous pairs of earbuds from Apple, Skullcandy, Sony, and Beats, I splurged and bought these. I also I had a pair of the Bose earbuds, which were amazing as well, unfortunately they were misplaced and haven&apos;t been found since. I listen to primarily rock but I also listen to a lot of hip hop and these headphones produce such an amazing sound that I will never get another brand of headphones! Bose simply makes the best quality sound systems out on the market!

The sound quality that the Bose QC15&apos;s have is simply amazing! I have never had the same quality of sound that ... comes from these headphones. When everyone says that you can hear different parts of the song, they aren&apos;t kidding. You can hear hidden rhythms and bass lines and it truely brings the music to life. It feels as though you are actually there with the artist listening to them play. The noise cancellation feature puts these headphones over the top! If you just want peace and quiet, they can be used without the headphone cord and you are instantly immersed in silence. I use my headphones when I&apos;m drumming and they are absolutely perfect! I can just turn on the noise cancellation and it gives my drums a more studio sound, rather than hearing the vibrations bouncing off of the walls. When playing music through them and drumming along I can hear the drums just enough so I can keep with the song but still receive amazing sounds of the music. They truely make listening to music an experience rather than something you do to pass the time.

The durability of the Bose QC15&quot;s is great! Just holding them in my hands, I feel as though they can&apos;t be broken (although there is a way to break everything haha). You can twist and bend them and torque them in ways that I&apos;d feel worried if I did that with other headphones. Also the design that has the ear pads swivel is much nicer than having them fold inward like some oth ...

     <Review>Pros: sound, comfort, sound, sound

Cons: nothing

i have wasted so much money on headphones in the past and finally gave in to spend the money on these. they are very comfortable and the noise cancelling is one the best i have experienced. the sound is very clear, crisp and even. keeping in mind these are labeled accoustic, the bass is very good on these depending on the music you listen to. extremely deep bass in some genres of music like rap/hip hop can be a bit distorted at times i have noticed, but since i mostly listen to jazz, pop, rock and oldies but goodies music the sound is far better than any headphones i have used in the past.
you can actually hear the full range of all vocals and instruments which makes you feel like you&apos;re actually there in person. i mostly us ... e them on my ipod touch and laptop. smaller mp3 players just dont have the kick to put out the sound but they absolutely punch on my Ipod touch.
i have read other reviews on durabilty but have not experienced any problems at all in that area, but then again as soon as i am done using them i put them in the case. i have always been a big fan of Bose products and will continue to buy Bose. its well worth the money spent. I have owned these for almost a year now

     <Review>Pros: Quality, NOISE CANCELLING!!!, Sound Clarity. Hey It&apos;s a BOSE, enough said.

Cons: Price, but it served the purpose so it was all worth it.

After going through four headsets to try to accomplish what I was looking for, the Bose QC15 has proven to be the only one that can deliver. I work at a Data center with over 10000 servers and network equipment with their fans spinning at full throttle to the point that in order to communicate with another person is to yell loud so that they can hear you. Purchasing this headset was going to be the ultimate test and let me just honestly say that the ambient noise in the server room literally just disappeared after turning the noise cancelling on. The only thing I hear is the music and with the volume set at medium not head banging lou ... d. I&apos;ve even showed it to my co-workers and all of their responses were a complete eye-popping &quot;AMAZING!!&quot;. As far as I&apos;m concern, my search is now over. End of Story.

     <Review>Pros: Great sound and noise cancelling

Cons: Price (not worth $300).

I was seriously considering the Klipsch headphones (priced at $150). My main concern was that many owners of them complained about the comfort after a few hours. This was a problem that I had with my previous headphones, and I HATED it! I decided to take the dive and spend $300 on these Bose QC15&apos;s. I&apos;ve been thinking about it for several months and after many comparisons, (and reading reviews#, decided that I am going to make the investment. The sound quality is fantastic, the comfort is fantastic, and the noise-cancellation is second to none. Again, pricey, but I will do my best to take excellent care of them, and hopefully- they will last for many many years to come. #Side note: their battery life of arou ... nd 35 hours is fantastic compared to others that are only around 20-25 hours.... or LESS)! ;)

There&apos;s nothing really to complain about this headphones. Just the fact that you have to buy the AAA batteries, but that&apos;s expected from noise cancelling headphones right?

I bought B&amp;W P5 and C5 headphones and they were not complete in their reproduction of the recordings. The bass was completely missing or muffled. I tried all of the over-ear Beats by Dre models and was unhappy with them all in their own individual ways. The Solo HD&apos;s hurt my head and seemed cheap. The Studio model came broken!! One ear didn&apos;t work. I thought the PRO model sounded OK, but they don&apos;t have an inline mic for my iPhone, so they were out.
I am very happy with these Bose headphones. They have nice sound. The noise canceling assists in clear music representation. I love the inline Apple remote!
I highly recommend these headphones!</Review>

     <Review>Pros: Sound Quality

Cons: Didn&apos;t help with audio on ipod

I bought these headphones since I had a trip coming up and could try them out on the plane. When I watched a movie on my ipod it was difficult to hear the actors talking if they weren&apos;t talking load. I only purchased them for the noise cancellation and to help with the audio on my ipod when traveling . The headphones did not help with the audio. They did a pretty good job of canceling out most of the noise from the plane ride but didn&apos;t improve the audio of my ipod. Although maybe nothing would help with this and it&apos;s just the quality of the ipod. The movie was new so I don&apos;t think that had anything to do with it. I ended up returning them, I didn&apos;t feel they were worth the price since the headphones didn&apos;t help me hear ... the movies I was watching. other than that the sound quality was great and they were comfortable. I just don&apos;t use headphones except while traveling.

     <Review>Pros: SOUND QUALITY!!! NOISE CANCELING!!!

Cons: Price...

If your reading this review then you are like me...want a good, long lasting product that performs as advertised! Well this is IT!

The bad...it is $300 and I would like to see a built in rechargeable battery!

DO NOT LET THESE TWO BAD THINGS STOP YOU!

The GOOD...the sound quality is AMAZING. I use them with my iPhone and I travel alot. I put them on and was instantly amazed. The sound was like a studio on my ears and the noise canceling is above par. Keep in mind that it does not cancel ALL noise without music playing. My daughter was talking to me and I could barely hear her. When music is playing then that is ALL you hear MUSIC!!

A good test is to listen to Jay-Z / Empire state of mind with ... regular headphones and then use the Bose. You will instruments and beats that you did not know was there before...

I compared over a month against the Dr. Dre Studio pair. I purchased these for several reasons. The noise canceling is better! I don&apos;t know the science of it but Beats just seemed to be more of a passive noise canceling versus active. Lastly Durability...the feel of the Bose is more sturdy. Also I went to 3 Best Buys in my area and all of the Beats demos were broken. Yes they were displays but the the Bose were not and for $300 they should take the abuse. I hope I helped...happy listening! (please forgive all typos, etc.)

     <Review>Pros: great quality, comes with hard shell carrying case, can use with/without music, all around great Bose product.

Cons: uses battery, but you supposedly get 35 hours so shouldn&apos;t be a problem

I will use these to help drown out noises when I sleep. But I first put them on today after I bought them and they are amazing. My house is loud, cars driving by, people walking around talking, airplanes flying overhead, boats outside, and I put these on and absolutely silence. First time in awhile I can concentrate, and tonight, sleep. The music quality is great, not for bass, but that is easily adjusted on the iPod EQ. I can&apos;t wait to use these on an airplane to test them out. Today I turned the TV on volume 60 and turned the oven hood fan on and went to my room (20 feet from both) ... where usually it is very loud from the TV and fan, and I heard nothing but silence. I recommend these if you are a student and want to study in silence or to some calm music, or work in a noisy place, or just want some peace. Definitely worth the $300 + warranty (just in case a speaker goes out or something). Definitely a MUST buy.

     <Review>Pros: Sound is clear

Cons: Price

Fisrt of all, these headphones are expensive, so you should buy these only if you really care about audio experience.

Build quality: These are solid rock, they feel very durable and the materials are top quality. The carrying case is also great, makes you feel the headphones are safe. The cord is detachable and feels very durable too. 10 out of 10.

Comfort: The qc15 are comfortable for sure. The ear cushions are super soft. I wear them for hours and keep enjoying them like i just put them on. They might get a little bit hot after long use but it is not a significative thing to me. Seriously, super comfortable hp. 10 out of 10.

Audio quality: My fisrt impression was WOW. Seriously, these hp sound awesome , they made me want ... to listen to my whole library again. I&apos;m personaly a classic rock/hard rock music listener and play the bass guitar (with a home studio and iphone bass amp) so I like the bass a lot. In some songs you might want to use the eq of your iphone/ipod (bass booster). Don&apos;t get me wrong, the bass is there, very warm and clear, but if you like a mind blowing bass you may be disappointed. The clears are crisp and the vocals are excellent. You&apos;ll hear things that you&apos;ve never noticed before on your favorite songs. 9.5 out of 10.

Noise cancelling: Okay, this is a very personal opinion so you might want to try these before buying them. The noise cancelling is great, not perfect but great. They definitively block out a lot of noise. You can still hear people talking though, but once you start playing your music everything will fade away. Some people feel a pressure when using noise cancellng, I personally don&apos;t care since they dont&apos; make me feel uncomfortable. Overall noise cancelling means less noise-more music. 9.5 out of 10.

Value for the price: Again my personal opinion. I would say they are worth every single penny. These are quite expensive hp so you should be very sure about getting these. I am satisfied with the product and do not regret buying th ...

     <Review>I looked around for a long time trying to find headphones that had a great sound and helped to block out noise without &apos;leaking&apos; too much sound. I work in an office cubicle and didn&apos;t want headphones that leak out a lot of sound that would disturb my office mates. I also wanted to drown out the noise that sometimes occurs in the office. When I tried on these Bose headphones at the store, they were instantly comfortable and the music sounded awesome even at a low level. When I wear them in the office, I only have to turn my Ipod up to the 50% level to get a full blast of music that sounds great and doesn&apos;t leak. The all around ear design helps with that perfectly. Also, the ear design has allowed me to wear them practically all day long without any discomfort. So once you get over the price ... and shell out the bucks, you&apos;ll be pleased with this great set of headphones that you can enjoy loud music, cancel out noise, and not disturb others around you!

     <Review>Pros: Sound, Comforable, Noise Canceling

Cons: maybe you need a AAA to use it, but battery life is long.

when i first got this over the weekend and used it. at first it was ok, for being around the home. my room is next to the washing machine. and boom the sound of the washing machine was gone. i couldn&apos;t hear my family calling for me even when they where next to me. and the sound is amazing. i love listening to my music even more now. Now for home use i don&apos;t think it was worth 300 dollars. but my main use for them is for work. i work around noisy machinery (and my employer lets us listen to music.) these machines run about 80-90Dbs. enough to make your ears ring slightly after working near them for 8 hours. i don&apos;t like the hearing protection they provide us. not very comfo ... rtable. but the QC 15 are super comfortable and as soon as i turn them on. boom major noise reduction. as soon as i put them on i enter another world. i feel like i am not at work anymore. but in a music video. and yes i can still perform my job. but these make the 300 dollors worth it and makes my job more fun. i love them. and in car rides. instead of hearing the car in the background of my music i hear crystal clear music. these are not the best sound quality out there. the beats is better sound quality. but Bose QC 15 has better noise canceling.(my friend has the beats) so if you want good quality music but doesn&apos;t have to worry background noise get the beats. but if you want to listen to music with out background noise get the QC 15. honestly, if not for work i would have no reason to have the QC 15 so if you buy then have a reason to get them. or you might not be satisfied with them.

     <Review>Pros: Comfort and Noise Cancellation

Cons: I&apos;m pretty sure $100 of the price is for the &apos;Bose&apos; name.

My wife bought these for me a year ago. I use them daily for things like watching Video CBT&apos;s at work/home, music and TV. I watch all my &apos;personal&apos; shows (mostly SciFi and such) in my own little man cave, always with headphones. I must have logged over 700 hours of use with these things over the last year. Except for a cord issue they are extremely durable and remain extremely comfortable to wear. I like to let people at work and such put these on and flip the switch. The noise cancellation always trips everyone out. I&apos;d say 95% of people out there have never tried noise cancelling headphones. Normally open can headphones sound the best but they leak noise outward and leak out ... side noise inward. I&apos;d say overall these exceed the sound quality of open can headphones and elminate almost all sound leakage (either way).

RECOMMENDATION:
-As with all headphones, I&apos;d suggest the first thing you do is Armor-All the cord, and repeat every month or two. The cord will be protected from cracking/drying and will also remain much more flexible.
-After 1 months of heavy use where I used a heavy coiled extension cord for TV viewing, the cord began to pull out away from the plug exposing wire. It&apos;s $15 to order a replacment (no big deal). I&apos;d just be careful about pulling on the cord or using something like a heavy extension. I also ordered the $15 lightweight bose matching extension and all is well now.

BAD:
-In general the sound quality is about the same as a $100 pair of headphones (before noise cancellation). Specifically I own a pair of $100 Sennheiser open-can headphones and the sound quality on these isn&apos;t much better. I really take it as $100 for sound quality and $200 for noise cancellation (probably $100/$100 + $100 for the &apos;Bose&apos; name).
-The base is over-done but I like it
-In some people the noise cancellation signal tricks the ear into sensing pressure. I never noticed this but it drives my wife crazy. She can&apos;t stand to wear them. Supposedly a couple of days of use wil ...

     <Review>Pros: Fantastic noise reduction and comfort.

Like many, I relied on earlier reviews for both these and the Dr. Dre Beats. I don&apos;t think there can be a clear winner - it&apos;s all about personal preference. After reading tons of reviews, I came to the conclusion: If you love hip-hop or rap with huge bass - then get the Beats. If not, get the QC15s.

My biggest deterrent to the Beats was the MANY comments about the noise leak. I experience none of that with these QC15s. I can watch a movie with these headphones blasting, and my wife can sit next to me on the couch watching a movie on netflix on her iPad. She doesn&apos;t hear my movie and I don&apos;t hear hers.

I like to listen to my music loud - I found out after having these headphones that the only reason I liked to have it so loud ... is so I would only hear the music. With these headphones, I can hear only the music, and I don&apos;t need to have the volume so loud. It’s fantastic.

As far as noise canceling, I think some reviewers were expecting earplugs, not headphones. They do a FANTASTIC job of blocking out ambient noise like our office’s server room, heating and most important to me – other coworkers! If someone comes into your office to speak with you, or your phone rings, you can easily hear it – but that is the point. What it does block out very well is the “hum” that you get with an office full of people speaking in their own offices. Without music on (but the headphones on) I can barely hear even my own typing or clicking. With music playing, I cannot hear myself type or click. It’s very relaxing. The noise canceling to me is very good. I’ve never heard better.

The headphones are the most comfortable pair I have ever had. I have worn them for hours at a time and they feel great. Very good job there.

Sound quality is great in my opinion. With these, I can tell a much bigger difference when I change the equalizer differences on my iPod and computer. I think my songs sound great and I can hear things very clearly. Much better than any headphones I’ve ever had before. ...

Cons: not as comfortable as demo, too expensive

Demo in store was much more comfortable. Sound was great, but really not worth the cost. Purchased because I had gift cards.</Review>

     <Review>Pros: These headphone do all that they advertise!

Cons: nothing - it&apos;s all good

I researched headphones, and when I went into Best Buy the display/try-me station confirmed my choice. Other headphones that claim the same features had obviously less quality in their padding, wires, and/or noise canceling feature! Also no others came with a case which would have raised their price. Best Buy&apos;s Bose display offered simulated noise and choices in music. Use that noise while testing another brand - they don&apos;t stand a chance!</Review>

     <Review>Pros: Comfortable and great sound

Cons: Cant use without batteries

Purchased these headphones prior to international flights for work. Used them on a trip to Europe and Asia. Worked great! Great sound when watching movies on my iPad and on the airplane personal video screen

Only drawback is you need to have batteries to use them to listen to music/videos or have the noise cancelling feature. However 1 AAA battery has lasted 18 hours of flying time.</Review>

Best headphone purchase I&apos;ve made. I looked around and tested many units before I finally pulled the trigger. I&apos;m very pleased that I went the direction I did as the sound quality and noise cancellation feature are stellar. I would definitely recommend this product to anyone where these two factors are key.</Review>

     <Review>When I first spotted these headphones in a store in Manchester and tried them, I immediately knew the quality, the build and the sound was just amazing. Then I looked at the price, oh dear!
I then went back home and after using my senheiser cans my mind was made up. The total difference with the audio quality and the fact that the volume of what you are listening to does not have to be loud, in fact because of the NC facility you can reduce the volume and save your ears the damage you would get trying to drown out the outside background noise. If only the price was a little less painfull but in my book you get what you pay for.
These are more than worth what you pay, Lets face it I like my music and I am not ready to have hearing aids to correct the damage what poor quality cans can ... do to your hearing.

Cons: The only negative I can say about this product is that they take batteries versus a lithium rechargable, extra $50!

I travel a lot for work on airplanes, so this is a must buy! Movies sound great, music is incredible and the ability to not listen to crying babies/boring conversations.</Review>

     <Review>Pros: Excellent sound, true noise canceling tech, comfort!

Cons: Your ears may get warm.

So $300 is a lot of dough for headphones right? I was skeptical that the QC15s would live up to the hype. Then I wore them on a LA to NYC flight, and after enjoying 5hrs of quiet, gentle music I arrived refreshed and more comfortable than I&apos;ve ever been after a long flight. Knowing what I know now, I would pay almost double for these headphones.

The reviews don&apos;t lie. CNET and many other consumer sources call the QC15s the best headphones money can buy.

Do you want the real thing or an imitator? I&apos;ve tried other noise canceling headphones, and they were good. The Bose 15s are the best. You&apos;ll know where your money went when you wear these on an airplane and flip the &quot;ON&quot; swi ... tch.

There are only 2 drawbacks you should know about. 1) because the earpieces wrap around your ears, your ears may become hot/sweaty during extended listening. 2) the noise canceling technology creates a negative pressure inside the earcup, which is slightly noticeable but not at all bothersome to me.

Pluses: the material Bose found for the earcups and headband covering is like magic. So comfortable! Flip the on switch and the dull roar of an airplane suddenly disappears. Even during take-off. It&apos;s almost spooky how quiet things get. You can also use the headphones w/out the cord attached if you want pure silence rather than music, which is a cool feature.

I can&apos;t recommend these enough. If price is your only concern, move on. If high quality sound reproduction with the best noise canceling technology is important, buy these!

     <Review>Pros: Utter Silence

Cons: Battery

Pros: Comfort, Style, &apos;Bose&apos; Satisfaction Guarantee, Noise Cancellation, Voice options, Ipod options

Cons: Battery required (but not to bad, avg of 35hours)

I&apos;m not entirely new to noise canceling headphones, but when I needed a pair to go to London, a 10 hour flight, I new I had to go with Bose. I use to have an old pair, but the design didn&apos;t quite work for me. You needed an AUX cable, that didn&apos;t stay in, and the pads touched my ears, which don&apos;t go well with someone with glasses.

But OMG these headphones are fricken amazing. No only do they fit around my ears they are perfect when it comes to sound cancellation. The built in microphones (the ones on the outside and inside of the ears) are the best idea they came up wi ... th. Also, the cord that connects &apos;clicks&apos; in and stays in. Also, there is a &apos;Hi,Low&apos; option for flights. Lo to prevent the huge volume in planes have and Hi for everyday use.

Usually, I need to have my headphones at max volume to hear the entertainment on a plane, which can strain your ears, but with Bose, I never go past 30% volume. I could hear everything perfectly and I couldn&apos;t hear the engines of the plane as I rode to and from London.

There is also the optional microphone for skype calls, phone calls, and volume control for iphones. Very useful since I usually don&apos;t like showing strangers that I have such a device on me when traveling. But it does look like I&apos;m talking to myself. Just a bit crazy.

The only thing I didn&apos;t like about these headphones was the fact that a battery is required to hear anything, but for the amount of time I used these things, I still haven&apos;t changed the battery and it has been more than 35 hours of use. I know I&apos;ll have to change it soon, but I&apos;ll know when cause there won&apos;t be anymore sound in the headphones.

Lastly, Bose has a 30 satisfaction guarantee and a no interest payment plan. For that I was willing to try them out while I was traveling and return them if I didn&apos;t like them. But I know that I&apos;m keepin ...

     <Review>Pros: Noise cancellation and product quality

Cons: Its very expensive :( and it would be great if it was wireless

I love my new headphone. They are amazing and exactly what I wanted. The product quality is great and the noise cancellation is excellent. One thing I was worried about the product was its batter. But to my surprise its batter life is great. One should not be worried about it at all. If you carry one extra AAA batter with you then I suppose you can go for a week though(on average public use). Its a great product; a bit expensive but value for your money :)

One thing I would love to see from BOSE is a good wireless headphone :)</Review>

     <Review>Overall the best headphones I have ever owned. The noise cancelling feature is amazing. What was also cool was the 1 year warranty the Bose came with. With that Bose truly has the best sound and superb modern style. Was pricey at $300 but I am so glad I forked out the money. Well worth it!</Review>

     <Review>Pros: Everything

Cons: Nothing

First I want to start by saying that this is a Bose product, you get what you pay for. They&apos;re $300 for a reason... they sound amazing. I was wavering between these and the beats. I use them for Music, Gaming, Movies, basically everything on my PC because I don&apos;t want to disturb anyone and I wanted great sound.

Pros:

1) Sound Quality - It&apos;s typical Bose, it looks quiet on the outside and blows you away when you listen to it. The sound is perfectly balanced, the bass on the Beats was a bit much for constant use.

2) Comfort - These are the most comfortable headphones I&apos;ve ever worn. They&apos;re extremely lightweight but well built. I noticed a lot of reviews on here knock the quality of this product but if you actually closely exa ... mine it, you will notice just how much thought actually went in to creating this product.

3) Noise Cancellation - I have never worn NC headphones before, but I must say it is extremely impressive; I can play Call of Duty on my PC and hear every little footstep while my girlfriend watches T.V. 3ft away from me and only hear my game.

4) Simplicity - I had purchased the $250 Tritton Pro Call of Duty headset prior to purchasing this, as well as some Turtle Beach headsets; all of which were designed to work great for gaming and provide the best performance. With all of their wires and fancy boxes they didn&apos;t even come close to sounding as good as these headphones and all I had to do was plug these in.

Bose has created a customer for life, I found it amusing that they include business cards for you to give people who ask you about your headphones. They know what they make is amazing, and they don&apos;t apologize for the price. I don&apos;t blame them :)

     <Review>Pros: perfect for plane rides

Cons: cost

have been looking at these for years - trying them on, listening, looking at reviews online. So expensive though. Finally, before a plane trip just walked into the store, grabbed them from the shelf and walked directly to the counter to pay. I am so happy i did. The are amazing. Great sound, comfortable to wear, blocks out lots of noise - even before there&apos;s music playing. My husband (aged 52) still has the first pair of Bose speakers he bought at 16 - i&apos;m hoping these last as long.</Review>

     <Review>Pros: Ability to cancel noise, even when not listening to audio

Cons: The price is rather high

I purchased these for two reasons, 1. to lessen the overall din in an office setting when I need to concentrate, and 2. for listening to movies on airplane flights. I&apos;ve used them in both situations, and they work well. On a recent 8 hour flight I watched three movies, the comfort was very good, the sound quality excellent.</Review>

     <Review>Pros: Very comfortable, good sound

Cons: Bose products seem to be pricey

I wore the Bose QuietComfort 15 headphones on two 8 hour airplane flights for the entire flight. The noise cancelling feature worked well and greatly reduced the engine sound as well as the conversations of nearby passengers. I listened to several airplane movies and could actually hear what the actors were saying. I also played music from my iphone and the sound was clear and of high quality. I&apos;ve never worn a more comfortable pair of headphones. Well worth the premium to have the Bose brand name. The traveling case is well constructed and was helpful in keeping the headphones in good condition. All necessary cords came with the headphones to use my audio devices. I highly recommend these headphones for ... traveling.

     <Review>Pros: Amazing sound quality, outstanding noise cancellation

Cons: A bit bulky for travel, but fold-flat case included

The sound is incredible and the noise cancellation is hard to believe. I use these mainly for long plane flights to watch movies on the iPad. I liked them so well I bought a set for my wife. Yes, $300 is a lot of money for headphones. These make the difference between muddy sound and hearing every word and every note despite loud background noise. Even the screaming kid in the seat behind you disappears.</Review>

I purchased this item because when I fly on an airplane I couldn&apos;t stand the noise of the engines or people talking while trying to enjoy music or a movie on my laptop. It is amazing how well you hear every detail of sound for music or when watching a movie. Totally blocks out the outside noise and these are great for if you are sleeping next to a snorer by just wearing them turned on at night. Great for getting that sound sleep. I wouldn&apos;t buy any other brand of noise reduction headphones.</Review>

     <Review>Pros: Sound, Comfort.

Cons: Maybe the cost but, they are worth it.

I work in a very noisy computer lab environment. Many of us use these headphones to reduce the noise in the lab. These headphones produce a very clear and crisp sound. Not only is the sound quality excellent but Bose has gone a long way to make these headphones comfortable. I put them on almost as soon as I get into work and hardly take them off all day. I would recommend these headphones to anyone who is tired of buying cheap products only to be disappointed by the sound and comfort.</Review>

     <Review>Pros: Great sound quality, cancellation really works, comfortable

Cons: Can&apos;t use it without noise cancellation

On airplanes it&apos;s perfect, but if you want to use it at home, and want to hear what&apos;s going on around, you can&apos;t turn off the sound cancellation and use it just as a normal pair of headphones. Of course, if you just want great sounding normal headphones, you could buy a pair for a lot less than the Bose 15, but for the price, why can&apos;t it be both?</Review>

     <Review>Pros: excellent noise cancelling

Cons: bass notes aren&apos;t as deep as some other headphones i&apos;ve tried

Overall these are very good headphones. I was looking at several sets of noise-cancelling headphones for when I travel. These, by far, did the best job in that regard. The only real drawback is that some of the other sets I tried had much deeper and more powerful bass. Not a huge issue for me, but it may be for others.</Review>

     <Review>Pros: Very soft headphones

Cons: After using it for a couple hours your ears start to sweat

Overall a great product. It is a bit pricey but your paying for a great product. As for sound quality it is very good. The sound is clear and precise. I do not hear any outside noise. Also it is great for plane rides where babies are crying on the plane. I just put these headphones on and I can finally take a nap w/o hearing a baby cry.

The only negative thing I have to say is that your ears start to sweat after using it for more than about 3-4 hours. Also the battery dies quickly if you do not forget to slide the button to off, which I always forget to do.</Review>

These headphones are great. They feel great and they sound awesome. I also love the noise cancellation feature.

They also have the perfect amount of bass so they don&apos;t hurt your ears.</Review>

     <Review>Pros: Sound Quality, Noise Canceling

Cons: Too much plastic

I fly out of state weekly for business and get asked frequently &apos;ARE THEY AS GOOD AS THEY SAY?&apos; or &apos;ARE THOSE THOSE ONES I SEE ON TV?&apos; - they are and their better when you hear them yourself!

The noise canceling is the best on the market - and this is statistacally proven, period. When Im allowed to turn them on at 10,000 ft. the sound of the engines nearly vanishes! You can still hear people talking. In fact you can hear the captian talk over the intercom better than if they were off. These headphones were not made to cancel the spoken word, but white, grey and I think pink noise (such as a fan or swamp cooler and such). The sounds that make your ears ring (tinitis) after a while. The saddest part of flights ... is when your ears get adjusted to the quiet and you have to shut them off for a landing - when you take them off the engines sound 2x louder.

Sound quality is more important to me than any feature. Honestly I bought a pair of $200 Sony headphones that ended up getting returned. I spent the extra $100 for these due to the fact I could HEAR the difference. If you enjoy classical, or any high fidelity audio then these are made for you. Roubust BASS, clear trebel and mid tones. You also hear every nuance so much deeper in audio tracks that were lost with such lousy sound equipment. You will want to re-listen to a lot of your music after getting these. THANK YOU BOSE!

     <Review>Pros: Sound quality and background noise elimination

Cons: Dropping $300 on headphones isn&apos;t easy, short battery life

Overall, the Bose QC 15 headphones are fantastic and they work as designed by eliminating the majority of background noise. To earn a little extra money, I recently started transcribing audio for a legal transcription business. At first, I used an older set of headphones and they worked well, but every time the A/C came on, the refrigerator ran, the dishwasher ran, or my wife watched TV, I had to deal with the background noise and distractions.
I decided to get a new pair of headphone and immediately thought of these. The only thing that made me hesitate was the $300 price tag, but after some product testing in a noisy Best Buy store, I was sold. I took the ... m home and started using them right away. The result was awesome. I was able to concentrate on the transcription work and was able to get more done in less time.
Other than the high price tag (the only reason I didn&apos;t give it a &apos;5&apos; in each category), the only negative thing I can think of is the seemingly short battery life. The headphones use a single AAA battery to power the noise cancelling feature. I was a bit surprised how quickly I had to replace the first one. The second battery didn&apos;t last much longer. Eventually, I got better at remembering to turn the feature off when I wasn&apos;t using the headphones, but the battery life was still relatively short.

     <Review>Pros: Great noise reduction

Cons: A little pricy

I purchased these as a present to me for my 70th birthday and for an upcoming flight to the west coast. I expected them to work well on the plane and they did. They are very comfortable to wear. I decided to try them when mowing the lawn instead of my normal hearing protection. I could clearly hear the music over the sound of the mower. The amount of noise reduction is amazing! I use them with my Ipod and Kindle Fire of if I just want it to be quiet when I read.</Review>

     <Review>Remarkably comfortable and the noise canceling technology really works well by blocking out the background din but not the unique sounds such as someone trying to get your attention. They&apos;re light weight and the ear cups are soft and don&apos;t apply too much pressure. Sound quality seems to be good, but I haven&apos;t put them through their acoustical paces, yet. My only complaint so far is the cord, which is very short.</Review>

Cons: Price

I have been watching this headphones for almost two years, waiting for their price to drop...

Well, as the price still is high, and three trips to make in a row, so decided to buy one.

Very good!</Review>

     <Review>Pros: Quiet, No sound spill in or out. Nice long cord, comfort

Cons: Pretty pricey and battery needs weekly replacement.

These headphones are amazing. I am a little hard of hearing and my wife can hear over Apple earbuds when I listen to my music/audio-books with them. She never says a word when I use the Bose product. The sound is fantastic and it totally blocks out out-side noise. The Phone and Play and Volume buttons on the cord are very sturdy and I haven&apos;t had any problems. I have yet to use them on an airplane flight but I am looking forward to doing that on Saturday.</Review>

     <Review>Clear sound Battery life is good. I probably have 50 - 60 hours on the stock battery right now and they are still going strong. I use them at work to kill all the background noise and other co-woorkers on their phones. I use them when I cut the grass. I don&apos;t have to have the headphones blasting my ears to hear the music. I would recommend to anyone.</Review>

     <Review>Pros: The noise canceling and sound are terrific.

Cons: A bit expensive. You have to have the noise canceling on in order for the sound to work.

These headphones are great for plane rides and for blocking out noisy air conditioning. I just wish I didn&apos;t always need to use the noise canceling (hence killing the batteries) in order to get any sound out of them. I do like to use them around the house where noise canceling is not needed so it would be nice to not waste the battery life. But they are a great headphone in general and it definitely makes my plane trips better.</Review>

     <Review>Pros: Comfort and sound

Cons: Style

I went back and forth between these and Beats Studio. I tried them both on over and over again. If you want to look cool, get Beats. If you want the most comfortable, light weight, best sounding, best noise canceling headphones, get these. I use these in an office full of talking people, when I turn these things on I don&apos;t hear anything but whats coming through the headphones. I have also used these while cutting the grass and they make my lawnmower sound like an electric, its crazy. The comfort and noise canceling is ridiculous, Flat Out!</Review>

     <Review>Pros: simple and comfortable to use

Cons: travel case is quite big

It turns a journey in Economy Class into a Business Class.
It makes the difference after 8 and 12 hrs of flight. You can use it alone with out any music or you can plug to ANY entrainment device aboard. The quality of sound is very good.
It&apos;s light and soft, and you don&apos;t mind using it again after you take them of for a wile.
You can also have a soft conversation without rising the volume of your voice on a plane.
Case is a little big. Bose can add some pockets and so for air tickets, passports and pens, since the size wont be smaller.</Review>

     <Review>Pros: Great noise cancellation and excellent playback of music

Cons: Price is a bit hefty, but considering the other alternatives the only choice for headphones

Although the price is a bit hefty, considering they are Bose headphones, you come to expect a pricier set of headphones.

I was looking for a set of noise cancellation headphones to use when I am operating my tractor or riding mower. After looking at the selection and reading the reviews, this seemed to be the best choice. As soon as you turn the switch on to the headphones, you immediately will notice a significant decrease in ambient noise.

I tried them the next day while riding my mower (rear engine, which blares in my ears), flipped on the noise cancellation and noticed a dramatic decrease in the nois ... e levels. So far, so good. Now to test them out with music...

The set comes with 2 cords, one for normal phone jacks, and one designed for an iPod. I have a no-name brand mp3 player so used the regular cord to plug in to the set. You must have the headphone switch to the on (noise cancellation) setting to be able to listen to external music devices. Prior to this set I used to have to turn my volume up all the way to drown out the noise from the mower and tractor, even then I could not hear the music very well, and it also lead me to get tinnitus (ringing in the ears). With the Bose Noise Cancellation headphones, I am now able to drown out the engine noises and play my music at half to less-than-half volume as previously played.

Great comfort too, as the phones hug the ears without leaving indentations or causing any discomfort in comparison to other earphones. I wore mine for over 4 hours while working on my tractor without any discomfort.

The headphones run on one (1) AAA battery and after many hours of use the original battery I placed in it is still working. Apparently it is not a battery hog.

So if you are looking for great headphones for use while working around noisey equipment I recommend these Bose headphones. Great sound!!!

     <Review>Pros: Sound quality and comfort.

Cons: has to have AAA battery

The noise canceling ability of these headphones is great. I can tune out airplane noise when traveling for more relaxing trips, and more importantly I can tune out the communal music and ambient sound of my open work place while I listen to my own music. :) These are much more comfortable than earbuds!!! They&apos;re expensive, but worth the money.</Review>

     <Review>Pros: Noise cancelling

Cons: Not so comfortable

I have a big head, I know that. I kept reading about how comfortable the Bose QC15 were so I thought I would spring the $300 to get them. They weren&apos;t painful but for that much money I shouldn&apos;t have to take them off every 20 minutes (if that) to relieve the pressure. I am not sure if it was the noise canceling that was bothering me or the fit. Either way, they weren&apos;t comfortable enough to justify the price. I also tried the QC3&apos;s and they were no better. Guess I&apos;ll stick with ear buds....</Review>

     <Review>Pros: noise reduction

Cons: a bit sweaty after awhile

I love my headphones and use them many times a day to listen to audiobooks. I had to learn to remember to urn off the headphones; that isn&apos;t instinctive. I can now listen to books while walking on my noisy treadmill. I also use the headphones, without an MP3 player, when the music is too loud at hockey games. I try very hard to protect my remaining hearing.</Review>

     <Review>Pros: Does what it says it&apos;ll do - sounds great - nice case

Cons: price - but worth it.

I bought these for a flight to FL &amp; back. I really have only used them twice so far. They deadened the engine noise by about 90% and almost completely with soft music playing. Where I was most thankful for them was the crying kids behind me. Another 90% noise reduction (and 100% sanity improvement). When I kicked up the music just a hair the baby disappeared. Great comfortable headphones but a bit pricey.</Review>

     <Review>Pros: Clear Sound; Lightweight; Amazing sound; Easy Controls

Cons: Hurts my head after 1 hr

This is a great product. The Bose name comes with high expectation of quality. The only thing keeping me from giving it a 5 is that my head and ears start to ache after about an hour of listening. They are light weight so I think it has something to do with the noise cancellation.</Review>

     <Review>The noise cancelling feature is outstanding in my opinion. I work in data centers where the fan noise is, to say the least, excessive. While these headphones have nice, crisp, clear sound quality, they do leave a bit to be desired in the overall volume output. However, when so much of the background noise is reduced, it really is a non-issue for myself. These are not inexpensive headphones, but I would definitely recommend them if your main goal is to reduce noise in a mostly white noise type environment. I use the microphone with my iPhone and the sound quality (as reported by the people I converse with) is fair to good quality.</Review>

I did alot of research before buying my first pair of noise canceling headphones. i actually went with able planet and after having them for a few weeks i sold them on ebay and purchased the bose pair. 100 times better if you are traveling on a plane more than 10 times a year, you must have these! the bass quality isn&apos;t the best, so i don&apos;t use these for causal listening.</Review>

     <Review>The noise canceling function is, by itself, outstanding. Combined with the crisp, luscious audio that these headphones provide make them a must have for travelers, or if you are often it noisy areas. Even if you&apos;re not in noisy areas, these headphones are amazing. I am a huge &quot;bassophile&quot; meaning I love bass, but the bass comes through on these headphones so well that you don&apos;t need bass boost or any bass amplification. I have the EQ on my iPhone set to Rock, and it sounds like a dream.</Review>

     <Review>Pros: Comfort with excellent noise cancellation

Cons: I don&apos;t have any complaints.

Silence! How sweet the sound. That is what you get with these. Put them on even in what you think is a silent room, and you will still be amazed as to how quiet it gets. Aside from canceling out sound around you, the sound quality is simply astounding. Bose continues to live up to its name by providing the highest quality sound in a device. I would not give these up for any other brand at any price. I wish they were cheaper, but the price has to be paid for comfort, noise cancellation, and sound quality that just can not be found in any other headphones. You will be extremely pleased with these headphones.</Review>

     <Review>Pros: Sound, Comfort, Durable, Case, Vertical/Angled Input Jack

Cons: Price, Won&apos;t work without Noise Cancel active, More insulation to keep sound within Ear space.

I did alot of research, figured I wouldnt spend $300 on headphones, but wanted something when I go on road trips and or study at starbucks. These headphones are without a doubt incredible. Sound Quality is good, comfort (even for me with larger than average ear size) is great. Price could come down some, but still worth every penny. I would be nice if you could use them without the noise cancelling as well, but it probably wouldnt sound as good. The reason they are so clear is because all outside noise is actively reduced to literally nothing. I can&apos;t even hear myself talk when listening to my Iphone. The one thin ... g that bugs me is when people can hear what I listen to, I know it&apos;s asking alot, but with these headphones, you can hear what someone is listening to. With the active cancelling, you can turn the music down and never hear the outside world, while not bothering everyone around you.

Cons: Manufacturing, product life.

Was enjoying the use of the headsets, worked great, until the warranty ended of course. At 13 months the right earphone stopped working all together. Tried everything, batteries, checked the connection, nothing worked. Its just another overpriced product that quits shortly after the warranty is expired. I&apos;m extremely disappointment........</Review>

     <Review>Pros: Noise canceling, comfort, ease of use, battery life, travel case, and did I mention the noise cancelation?

Cons: Bass at loud volumes and unfortunately quite loud from the exterior allowing people to hear what you hear.

I put some thorough research into these before I bought these. After I finally listened to them, they blew away my expectations. From the moment you turn the headphones on everything in the world just stops. Bose invented noise cancelation and they seriously upped their game from their previous models making this masterpiece. As the name says QuietComfort, they do just that. They are the most comfortable and silent over the ear headphones out there. These headphones are a little loud do to their speaker configuration which means other people around you c ... an hear what you are listening to but honestly, who cares? At high volumes the bass does get a little distorted and sounds a bit &quot;bright&quot; but with the noise cancelation half volume on anything should suffice. These are a great buy and deserve some serious credit, mad props to Bose. Anyone who is comparing between this and the Dr.&apos;s Beats should go with this no question. Don&apos;t jump to the Beats for the brandname.

     <Review>Pros: Cancels nearly all ambient sound and provides excellent quality

Cons: Price, has to be &apos;on&apos; in order to hear anything.

I use these headphones exclusively on the airplane and what a difference they make. Before these, I had a set of $30 earbuds (not cheap, but not top of the line) and I used to have to crank my iPod up to the max in order to hear podcasts clearly when on the plane. With these headphones, I no longer have to do that. The sound quality is very good and they cancel nearly all of the background noise when in use, but the price is a deterrent. One other downside is that they have to be turned &apos;on&apos; in order for any sound to come out whatsoever, so they cannot be used during takeoffs and landings.</Review>

     <Review>Pros: Very comfortable to wear.

Cons: A bit pricey but still worth the money.

These headphones are great for noise reduction especially while flying in jet airplanes. Use of these headphones makes flying a lot more comfortable and relaxing. The noise reduction is the best and the quality of sound of the music is up with the best of quality headphones.</Review>

     <Review>Pros: Everything

Cons: Cost too much

These headphones are superb in all aspects except one. They are not worth the price tag. They have excellent sound and comfort. They cut out background noise perfectly. There is nothing wrong with these headphones. It is a matter of personal preference to pay the price. I am returning them today just cannot justify the price I paid for them for how much I will use them or the sound quality. $300.00 is way too much for these. Sound is great but in reality they are not much better than the $29.99 pair of Sony earbuds I have owned for over 2 years.
If I was a frequent traveler on aircraft I would keep them. Do not get me wrong they are very good quality headphone. It all comes down to personal preference. Do I or don&apos;t I you be the judge.</Review>

     <Review>Pros: eliminate background noise and deliver great sound

Cons: a hard case would provide more protection, price is high

I got these as a gift from work - I love them but I&apos;d have a hard time paying $300 as well. $300 will buy an awful lot of alternative electronics.

That said, with the ipod, these are the greatest things ever invented for relaxing and passing time in airline glorified bus seats. Yesterday I let the person sitting next to me try them out - have done this before. I love to watch the reaction when they put them on with power off, then turn them on. I didn&apos;t realize the background noise wore on me so much until I started using them. I would never fly without them. I wouldn&apos;t trust the soft case in luggage either - I wear it around my neck and tuck my ipod ... in the sleeve outside. I generally don&apos;t wear them at home, though I have when doing yard work before. Sound quality is excellent - anyone that says it isn&apos;t top rate is trying to sell something else.
I like the AAA battery - they last quite a while, and I keep a spare or two in the case. I can&apos;t recharge a battery in the middle of a 3 hour flight, and I can buy AAA batteries anywhere - so I woulldn&apos;t be interested in the newer model.

     <Review>Pros: It really does cancel out the noise of the airplane!

Before buying the Bose noise-canceling headphones, I had another name brand. The reason I had purchased the other brand was there were considerably cheaper than the Bose. When I tested them in the store, they didn&apos;t seem to have a huge difference from the Bose. After using them other brand for a couple flights, I found I wasn&apos;t impressed. I could still hear the roar of the plane when wearing them, they were slightly uncomfortable on my ears and they diminished the quality of the music. The quality of the music is important to me. With another flight coming up, I decided to bit the bullet and buy the more expensive Bose. I do not regret that decision. The technology that Bose uses to reduce the noise of the plane, does not re ... duce the quality of the music. I noticed that the Bose reduced the plane noise much more than the other name brand did. And, the Bose headphone also fit more comfortably over the ears, which is great on those longer flights. If quality of music and comfort are important, then the Bose noise-canceling headphones are the way to go!

     <Review>When my husband informed me he wanted these headphones for Christmas and I saw the price, I was sure he had received a head injury. He did receive his Christmas wish and was over the moon. When I used them my own self the first time, I was blown away by the quality of sound and comfort. Now, he has to share on a regular basis with me as these the most amazing headphones I&apos;ve ever used.</Review>

     <Review>Pros: noise reduction and sound quality

Cons: price is intimidating but will be a lasting product

I received the headphones for Christmas, but knowing how much they cost, I came very close to returning them. Once I took them out of the box and used them the first time....well there is NO WAY these are going back. I have watched several movies while jogging on the treadmill and wearing the headphones. They are very lightweight and comfortable. The amount of noise reduction is adjustable and one AAA battery lasts between 30 and 40 hours. I can&apos;t wait to use them on the airplane when I travel.</Review>

These were purchased as a gift for my son at Christmas. He needed something to block out as much noise as possible while he studies for exams. These are wonderful and well worth the price. I have even used them to listen to music. They are great for that as well. I highly recommend them and they are not over priced for their value.</Review>

     <Review>Pros: they really work and sound awesome!

Cons: everybody knows they are expensive so now your a target while wearing them (and your bookbag if seen putting them there)

These headphones are EVERYTHING they say they are, everything.
Coolest of the cool - just wearing them and turning them on (batteries included) (no music - just on) ambient sound is removed and/or diminished greatly - Wow! How&apos;d they do that? Who knows, but it works - amazing. WARNING: do not wear these while driving or ANYTHING in which hearing someone or something is necessary to your safety -YOU will not hear it !</Review>

     <Review>Pros: Great Sound; Comfortable; Lightweight

They really are everything you read about in other reviews. Lightweight, fit comfortably, great sound and noise canceling. Too big to work out with, but best for traveling or just listening to music. Would like to see better pricing or promotions, but you get what you pay for. I tested a lot of others and Bose are the best all around. Others have great sound and decent NC, but I didnt think we&apos;re as portable, which is important if you travel a lot.</Review>

Excellent sound quality and comfort - very good noise-cancelling for deep sounds, but not so much for high pitches. Music sounds terrific - my home has never been so quiet - what kids?</Review>

     <Review>Pros: great sound

Cons: doesn&apos;t cancel noise

My husband and I tried the bose noise canceling head phones on in the store and loved them, they seemed to work great, so I bought them for him for christmas. When we used them at home they don&apos;t cancel ANY noise by themselves without music, and with music on they only cancel a little bit of noise. We used them on a plane and the sound is great but it didn&apos;t really help with the background noise. It definitely didn&apos;t end up being worth the $300 dollars I spent on it.</Review>

These headphones are the most popular noise canceling headphones.

Light and comfortable however for the money there are others that cancel noise just through being a closed back around the ear design that sound way better.</Review>

Yes it is pricey, but is worth it in my opinion. Have used it on numerous flights and I am very satisfied with them. Takes a while to get used to the ear plugged up feeling, but being able to sleep on a plane next to the emergency exit....priceless.</Review>

     <Review>.......ok maybe not always, I had bought the Dre beats noise cancellation studios for $299. Loved they way they looked. After taking it home I immediately had buyers remorse because the sound quality and noise cancellation isn&apos;t there yet, but more importantly I didn&apos;t like everyone being able to hear what I was listening to. Returned it next morning for the bose qc 15. Immediately realized I made the right decision. I thought I was making a bass trade off but with a equalizer on my phone there isn&apos;t. Go with the bose.</Review>

     <Review>Pros: Everything

Cons: Price

I went back and forth between the beats by dre and the QC 15 for a very long time before finally deciding on the QC 15. The main selling point for me was the great noise canceling technology. It gets rid of almost every sound around me no matter what I am doing and really helps me to concentrate because of it.
I am a college student and while putting up $300 for them was rough, it has paid off when trying to do homework or studying in a noisy environment. As soon as you put them on it&apos;s almost like everything stops all around you. I would highly recommend them!</Review>

     <Review>Pros: They&apos;re light, comfortable on ears, great ambient sound attenuation, awesome sound quality.

Cons: As usual with Bose products, they&apos;re overpriced. They cannot be used for music listening without a battery.

Having worked as a Telecommunications Tech. for 25 years and knowing the mechanics of &apos;noise cancellation&apos; (It should actually be called &apos;Noise Attenuation&apos;) I have to say that the QC15 headphones do the best job at attenuating background sounds over the widest frequency range I&apos;ve seen yet. Low level background sounds are virtually eliminated. The use of a single AAA battery limits the level of attenuation, allowing the louder sounds leak through but at a significantly lower volume. The sound quality when listening to music is everything you would expect from the Bos ... e brand name - &quot;Superb&quot;, to put it in a single word.

The only issues I have with the QC15 headphones are The Price - you’re paying mostly for the Bose brand name – and the fact that they cannot be used for music listening without being ‘turned on’, requiring you to carry a spare battery or two whenever you’ll be using them. Battery life could be longer but considering the use of a single AAA battery I guess it’s pretty good as is. Some people have remarked on durability and they are right. You have to treat these, as well as the previous Bose headphone models, as if they are valuable and delicate precision instruments, which is pretty much the case since you’ve laid out big $$$ for them. Make use of the semi-hard case they come with when transporting them and don’t ‘stuff’ them into tight bags. Take good care of them and they will give you many years of quality service.

To sum up, the Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones live up to the Bose name in quality and performance. I wish Bose would bring their prices down but until they do, if ever, the QC15s are worth the investment for those who are looking for a great listening experience and can afford them.

     <Review>These headphones block out more of the white noise than the others that I have tried. So much so that I don&apos;t have to pump up the volume as much to get a clear, crisp sound. (No I don&apos;t work for Bose; I just appreciate great sounding equipment/product)</Review>

     <Review>Pros: Sound is near perfect.

Cons: TOO fragile!!! They wont last.

Sound is great sure... but what good is that when they are broken.
-Pads wore down fast shedding little black pieces everywhere.
-Pads blew out completely in two years of light use.
-After the first year the metal strip broke clean through the plastic in the headband. (I was able to repair that)
-Within a year and a half the swivel on the other side was broken.
-Finally just short of two years and they are beyond repair.
-Bose will not take care of me :(

I am VERY careful with my equipment. I always stored the phones in the case and never threw them around.

I have replaced them with Sony Noise Canceling Phones from Best Buy and I am happier. Even if they break... I literally buy ... 7 pairs of Sonys for the price of the Bose. ...and the sound quality is same.

Save your money. What is now old technology wrapped in cheap plastic is not worth it.

Have a nice day.

     <Review>Pros: Sound quality, noise cancelling technology, comfortable fit

Cons: Nothing

I work for an airline. I have used this product often while traveling &amp; at work during my breaks. The Bose QC 15 are the best headphones I have used to date. While traveling on aircraft the noise simply disappears. While on my breaks at work, in a very noisy environment, they help me to feel like I far away from all the stress of the job &amp; load noise. The Bose QC 15 headphones are simply amazing, and I&apos;ve tried numerous other products before buying Bose. There are some that some close to the performance of Bose. However, none match its superior sound quality &amp; noise canceling technology.</Review>

     <Review>Pros: Best Bose NC headphones yet...

Cons: $300 is $300...

IMO, these are excellent headphones... I can&apos;t say it any simpler than that. I work from home and I usually end up working late most nights. My office is right next to our bedroom and my GF usually goes to bed a good hour or 2 before I do. I just pop the QC 15&apos;s on and either plug them into my laptop or my Bose computer speakers so I can listen to iTunes or whatever... It is a win-win situation for both of us. It also helps me get more work done during the day as they help to block out all of the &quot;distractions&quot; one has when working from home.

The sound quality is very impressive. They are extremely comfortable too - at least they are for me. Not too bulky on my melon. I actually have to watch getting up from my ... desk with them still on - that is how good of a fit they are for me.

The only negative I can think of is that you need to watch the volume on your output source. It can leave a bit of a ringing in your ears if it&apos;s up too loud. At least that has been my experience. I guess for those not accustomed to NC technology, it can be a bit of an adjustment. And yes, they are a bit pricey, but I got them 18 months - no interest from BB...
Not a bad deal at all.

     <Review>Although everyone has different audio preferences when it comes to the sound quality they are looking for, I found that these headphones were excellent for me. What I first liked about them was the weight, they were light and did not feel like they were weighing my head down or feel like they were going to slip off. (I compared these with other Bose models and Beats by Dre headphones). It was also important that it had good sound, and this product delivered. It was also important to me that it really was truly noise cancelling. I was impressed with the technology and I can wear these in the office to do work and not be distracted or use them to listen to webinars. I also enjoy them at home when my boyfriend is playing video games and I want to block out the sound. This also help with the &quot; ... fighting&quot; for sound problem. I can not wait to use these on a flight! I will not use these at the gym. I have a cheaper pair of in-ear buds that I use for that. So if they break or I lose them I won&apos;t be heartbroken.

You get what you pay for. Bose® QuietComfort® 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling® Headphones does just what it says. When I fly the headphones will block almost all the unwanted sound and lets me hear my music without the background noise.</Review>

These headphones are incredible! I have an acute ear for music, and these things let me hear the music like I&apos;ve never heard before. They&apos;re very comfortable and stylish too. Plus they don&apos;t wear down on the battery too much. I&apos;ve been using them on one battery for an entire month now!</Review>

     <Review>Pros: The noise canceling ability

Cons: Like any headphones, they can be fatiguing after prolonged use.

I bought a set of these headphones for my son last year because he is sensitive to sound. He primarily uses them on airplanes and in the car to listen to his iPad. I tried them out a couple of times on business trips and found they worked extremely well for blocking out engine noise. Bought a set for myself as well. They allow me to listen to music or movies on a plane without having to turn the volume all the way up as I have to do with earbuds. The price is comparable to other noise canceling headphones.</Review>

     <Review>Pros: Sound quality, comfort.

Cons: Using at the gym - they don&apos;t stay on your head very well when you lay down. They&apos;re too bulky for the gym anyway.

Sounds amazing. Very comfortable to wear. Couldn&apos;t imagine listening to music through any other headphones after having these. The only issue I&apos;ve noticed was that they would cut out here and there when I would chew on food (ice in particular) and when I would sneeze - things of that nature. However, I changed the battery and haven&apos;t had the same issues since.</Review>

     <Review>Pros: noise cancellation

Cons: lacking bass

These headphones are just a tad expensive and lacking in deep bass. Sound is still rich and deep and very comfortable to wear for hours.

The noise cancellation is really why I bought them. I work in a noisy office with fans, space heaters and roof top ac units. These headphones cancel it all out. I can still hear a nearby conversation but the hum and buzz is gone. Many times I find myself wearing them without any music.</Review>

     <Review>Pros: Hours of comfortable wear.

Cons: Always the price, but, you get what you pay for.

Sturdy storage case: plenty of room for your iPod, mini amp(which I highly recommend), extra batteries and I even keep a small USB power supply thats about the size of a deck of cards.
Premium sound: Noise-cancelling feature is superb and the fact that you can use these for just some quiet time without the cable connected is a nice feature.
Only negative is that you have to have turn power on to hear music, all the more reason to carry an extra AAA battery. Plus, why else would you buy them if you aren&apos;t going to use the noise cancelling function?</Review>

     <Review>Pros: Everything

Any real music lover knows that you cannot put a price on the perfect sound quality, but for 300 bucks these are a steal. Bose is arguably the most trusted company in speakers/headphones and these do not disapoint. The noise cancelling is great for escaping the outside world into your music. Not to mention you can wear them all day with no discomfort. I have owned many headphones in my life and I reget not getting these sooner.</Review>

     <Review>Pros: The noise canceling and sound quality.

Cons: The price.

These headphones are by far the best, but you pay am premium for them. I guess it is true, you get what you pay for.</Review>

     <Review>Pros: Noise cancelling, high quality sound

Cons: Battery does not shut off automatically, had to buy optional cord to use with Android phone.

Bought this product for use on airplanes. The noise cancel feature is great! Not sure why Bose designed a product where you have to manually turn off the battery for noise cancelling though. Seems like it should shut itself off after so much time. Also, had to buy a separate attachment to use with an Android phone- comes with an Iphone attachment that is NOT compatible with Android. Had to go to Bose on the web to get it. I&apos;m a bit hard of hearing, so, this product is perfect for use as a cell phone headset too! As for sound quality, you will hear things in your music that you have never heard before! Strongly recommend this device - I ... will buy another one when this one wears out!

     <Review>Pros: Noise cancellation

Cons: durability

Good product, but I don&apos;t think it will last more than 2 years.
Sound is good, it really isolates noise.
USD200 it&apos;s the value for me. Little expensive, but didn&apos;t found alternative in the market.
I&apos;m happy with it, but Bose can improve.</Review>

     <Review>Pros: Noise cancelling/Sound quality

Cons: They require batteries

These headphones deliver high quality sound while blocking outside noises. I have high-velocity floor fan in my office. When I put these headphones on and turned them on, the very loud noise of the fan was reduced to a very faint whisper. I highly recommend these headphones, especially for frequent airline travelers.</Review>

These headphones are great. Very comfortable, except when my ears/head start to sweat! If the price were around $150, I would have rated them higher?</Review>
