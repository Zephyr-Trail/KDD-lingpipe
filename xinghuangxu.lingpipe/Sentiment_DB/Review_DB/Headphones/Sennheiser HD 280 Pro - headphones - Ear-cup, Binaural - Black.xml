Sennheiser&apos;s ruggedly constructed HD 280 Pro high-performance headphones feature comfortable leatherette ear cushions, a headband, and a foldable design for compact storage. Weighing a relatively lightweight 10 ounces, this $199 model has a 10-foot coiled cable fitted with a 1/8-inch miniplug. Sennheiser also includes a 1/4-inch adapter for use with a home stereo.

Our listening tests started i ... n our living room. The naval battle scenes sprinkled throughout the Master and Commander DVD amply demonstrated the HD 280s&apos; power and glory. These &apos;phones can play loud, and their bass definition was quite good, though not the equal of Ultrasone&apos;s mighty HFI-650s. But this well-recorded DVD sounded crisp and clear on the HD 280 Pros, with the sort of detail you hear only from high-end speakers.

Cons: Bulky and heavy, may not fit larger heads, not particularly durable

The Sennheiser HD 280 Pro headphones have been around for many years, but reviewers say they stand the test of time. The 280s feature a circumaural (around-the-ear) design, which means that they can block out some ambient noise. ...</Review>

     <Review>Pros: There is a lot to like and it is obvious why these things have enjoyed such high reviews for so many years. 
-The packaging was simple and easy to open, but protected the product nicely through shipping.
-The build quality is superb. I can feel that these cans will last me quite a long time. 
-Most parts are easily user replaceable through sennheiser&apos;s website.
-The cans are big and have no problem completely surrounding my big doofy ears and providing a nice seal from ambient sound.
-The sound quality is unmatched by anything in this price range. I am learning to rediscover all of my music, and these headphones have actually caused me to respect my favorites bands more now that I can truly hear the finer points of the songs. You will hear things in songs that you have ... never heard before.
-The bass is excellent and even capable of literally thumping on my head.
-The frequency range of 8Hz-25KHz is really a cool experience. You will hear everything.
-They are very comfortable

Cons: -They will highlight the weaknesses of your source equipment. My computers integrated sound card has never shown me any issues before, but while wearing these headphones the signal noise from the pc is very irritating and distracting. My next purchase will probably be a dedicated sound card.
-They can be quiet when used with a small source as they require a lot of power.
-They are closed design which works great for sound isolation, but heat can build pretty quickly.
-They are pretty bulky and heavy and a bit too big to comfortably wear around the neck.
-The cord is much too long for my uses, but probably not so for many others. 
The above is very much nitpicking and are probably not anything that i would even recommend that sennheiser address in a future revision.

These work great on an iPod, but you will likely not want to wear them for anything but stationary use. The 3.5mm plug is the perfect size and fits into the case on my iPhone without any issue. They do need to be turned most of the way up to be adequately loud for my tastes and the EQ needs to be set on bass booster, but that is personal preference. When connected to my home theater receiver they absolutely shine. I find myself listening for hours on end searching for nuances in songs i have yet to discover.
YOU WILL NOT WANT TO GO BACK TO OTHER HEADPHONES. After using these I lament having to use my sport headphones for the gym because of the stark contrast in quality. Be warned... there is no going back and ignorance is bliss in this regard.

     <Review>Pros: Im REALLY glad I bought these headphones! 
Extremely Clear highs, studio quality deep bass. Even hits those dirty dubstep lows. They block a lot of the background noise. The can reach over 100db and makes game explosions feel real. Lightweight. The fold/tilt almost every direction. The cord is a coiled professional grade and hasnt been damaged when I get up and walk away forgetting when they are on.

Cons: -Plastic construction. 
-The foam/ear cushion degraded after a few months, but easy fix with superglue.
- I wont get to buy another pair of headphones anytime soon, these are holding up fine.

These have the best sound per dollar. I did a TON of homework before I bought these, and even tryed a few at the store. NewEgg has the best prices you will find on thes ... e new. 
I play a TON of Bad Company 2 and Crysis style games. Farcry2 - these are the BEST for gaming for under $150. period. 
Paired with a Soundblaster X-fi, these will make any MP3 or ultra compressed youtube video sound unbelievable!! With on-board sound is excellent. Even hooked to my phone on plane rides was a hi-def surprise! Wow sound goes right to your soul! Never buying cheap headphones again! My friend had the Sony MDR7506, and they are slightly better all the way around, possibly more bass than the HD280&apos;s. The Sony studio monitors (MDR series) have metal contruction, and better quality pads and cushions, and slightly higher quality output, but over $125 more. Any headphone less priced than these is knowticably cheaper sound quality. The Panasonic 50mm speaker are toys in comparision.

     <Review>Pros: There is a reason that this model of headphones has been seen as a real gem, among both pro &amp; casual users for so many years.

Sound quality is near-perfect, build quality is great, and unlike almost all modern electronics they are designed for long-term use (including repair).

These &apos;phones are comfortable (enabling hours of use at a time) &amp; provide excellent sound isolation. The full freq. range is represented (minimal coloring), making them a great budget choice both for casual home use, &amp; serious professional applications. If you&apos;ve done mixdown work on average mid-range headphones, you will find yourself in the wonderful/horrible position of having to go back &amp; re-mix EVERYTHING. Even casual listeners will notice things they&apos;ve never heard in their f ... avorite music.

Ignore any complaints about &quot;lack of bass&quot; as the rantings of people weaned on &quot;bass-boost&quot; bullsh*t. These are not toys for children. The low end goes below the theoretical threshold, vibrating your skull nicely

Cons: If there is a flaw to be found in these headphones, it is a slight high mid-range coloring of the sound. They will work best with proper monitor speakers for A/B reference, but with a bit of practice can be used as a sole mixdown source.

There is definitely a break-in period; like wine or steak, these &apos;phones need a bit of time to &quot;age&quot; properly. I found my first pair really hit their stride after several months of use. Low end will be less developed immediately out of the box, but will mature to full richness with regular exercise.

I can&apos;t speak highly enough of these headphones. I got my first pair 7 years ago, &amp; only replaced them with my current pair because I caught them on sale. Due to their robust design (including replaceable parts), I could have continued using pair #1 indefinitely. Even at full price, they are extremely affordable, &amp; provide a fantastic price-to-use ratio.

Basically, I&apos;m a lifer.

     <Review>Pros: Sound Quality, Price, Comfort

Cons: They exert very little pressure on the ears, but so little than music leaks to the surroundings

Sennheiser has a fantastic heritage of great products, however i know, like most German brands, they usually sound great on classical, jazz, light rock, aka very little bass because the music is dominated by mids and highs. To my VERY pleasant surprise, the headphones carry a very good bass response to them without mudding down the mids or crisp highs. These were 70 in-store, which is a terrific value, espec. compared to the 80 Sony&apos;s touting the ultimate bass experience, which left me questioning whether or not Sony testers understood bass, but that&apos;s a whole different topic. Bottom line, these are fantastic headphones, and are definitely ... the best in-stores, perhaps with or behind the AE2 or the Dre Series, which are double or triple the price. These are also very very comfortable because they exert very little pressure on the ear, however this is the ONLY fault in them. They exert so little pressure that a perfect seal isn&apos;t created which causes a slight musical leak to the surrounding. For $70, these are a fantastic buy, and worth the extra 20 over the trendy skull candy&apos;s.

     <Review>Pros: Clear, crisp highs, full mids and excellent bass response. 
Excellent quality, hard to believe these cost $99. Over-the-ear keeps out a LOT of unwanted stuff.

Cons: None that I can think of, unless you have a size 8 head. A little tight, but that can be a good thing.

Admittedly, I&apos;ve been out of the audio scene for a LONG time but these are impressive. However, nothing I remember sounded quite this good.</Review>

     <Review>Pros: great sound, bass is normal, but probably not enough for teenage bass lovers.
I hear a lot of sound I never know it&apos;s there before, totally blow my mind. 
comfortable enough for 1 hr

Cons: heavy and bulky is my first impression and it still is. The weight really threw me off the first time I put it on, wondering where is comfortable I saw in other reviews. 
I can&apos;t use this more than 2 hrs even I has been using this for 4+ months. just hurts.
May be it&apos;s partially my glasses.

obviously , one of the best in &lt;$100 range. I got this for under $80, very happy. But I would consider throw in more money and get some thing more comfortable next time I buy headphone. Will try to walk in store to trial next time. After all, the sound, comfortable, etc. , are jus ... t personal preference, can&apos;t base every on reviews. Too bad, no such big store in my town.
First I thought it&apos;s just headphone, why spend so much money on it. But just like car, computer and other things, if you enjoy it, have money, go for it. Start cheap, work your way up and appreciate the upgrade. My $80 jump from $25 is like new laptop after 3 years, ready me to throw old one away with pressure.

     <Review>Pros: The sound is amazing and very well balanced. Excellent bass and mid-range response and the highs are well defined. The cord is long and coiled. The 30+ db noise reduction is there. In fact its so good you get immersed in whatever you are listening to.

Cons: None, really. I should have bought two.

At the price I got these for, they were a steal. These are very well made headphones. The noise reduction is outstanding.</Review>

     <Review>Pros: These headphones are pretty good. They do isolate well. Soundstage is good but not huge. Hooked up to my cmoy headphone amp I got great bass and great highs. The detail is good too. They might even have a little more detail than my Grado sr-80&apos;s. These do well with all types of music...except for metal. They&apos;re great...just not for me though.

Cons: These cans lack midrange. I took off my Grado&apos;s and the first thing i thought when i put these on was &quot;wheres the midrange?&quot; Heavy guitar riffs sound weak. You just cant rock out to such weak guitars. The sound signature of these cans is v-shaped (ie. they have lots of bass and lots of highs, but no mids). The coiled cord can be kind of awkward too.

So anyone that says these dont have bass obviously doesnt have a headphone ... amp. on some songs it sounded like there was a subwoofer next to my head. THERE IS BASS. 

Final thoughts: these are worth the $100 you can get them for. I wouldn&apos;t pay any more for them because then there are better options for about $130. Don&apos;t buy these if you like metal.

     <Review>Pros: I was using an ancient pair of AKG studio monitors, which still sound pretty good, but the Behringer headphone amp I&apos;m using didn&apos;t really drive them very loud. I have had several Sennheiser phones in the past (my favorites: the now discontinued 414), I read the reviews and thought I&apos;d try these. Claims that people were listening to ipods with these sounded a little exaggerated, but they are not. These things play crazy loud even on an ipod, and my Behringer amp drives them just fine-very good bass response, crystal highs. I would recommend these for just about any use. They&apos;re a little large to be walking around downtown with but personally I consider these home/studio use headphones. These have a 3.5 mm plug with a 1/4&quot; screw-on adapter-makes them very versatile. They fold up for ... easier transport. Good build quality. The pads have enough room to fit around my ears with a little &quot;wiggle&quot; room to help alleviate &quot;pad fatigue&quot;-see below.

Cons: I have a pretty big noggin, so the band squeezes the pads against my head a little too tightly. Not really a con but these things seal well around your ears. Nice if you&apos;re playing an instrument and moving around-they won&apos;t easily slide off. But it gets a little tiring after a while.

Compared to my old AKGs these things have almost subwoofer-like bass, which I consider a good thing. Very transparent sound, though. Really worth the money. 20 years ago my old &apos;Phones were more than twice the price.

     <Review>Pros: These headphones are phenomenal. The audio quality they produce is the best I&apos;ve ever heard out of any headphones and rivals my home stereo speakers. I&apos;m hearing nuances to my music I never knew existed. Bass...if that&apos;s your thing... is tight and accurate. Highs and mids crisp and clear. Extremely comfortable for hours on end (use them for online lectures).

Cons: None!

Didn&apos;t want to list this as a con as it is personal use dependent, but they&apos;re pretty &quot;big&quot; headphones. You&apos;ll look a little goofy if you toss them on your head in your cube at work....but this is not what they&apos;re for.</Review>

     <Review>Pros: Incredibly tight and accurate bass, not washed out, and at the proper volume they literally vibrate on your head (THX bass test). Snug fit, tough cable and replacable parts if need be. The high frequency response is up there too, and is not washed out by the bass.

Cons: Might be too tight fitting for some, you need flac or 320kbps to really get the high sound clarity (remember, linear sound reproduction).

Had the bose triports for quite a while... they broke. If comparing to the bose note that the HD280&apos;s feel much more durable, and the sound quality doesn&apos;t even compare - these cost less also. The sounds used to test out the frequency response was mainly Nine Inch Nails, Crysis, and THX demos.</Review>

     <Review>I have been using these HD280&apos;s in a home studio for about two weeks now. Not yet fully broken in but I am already happy. Bass extension is better than my Mackie monitors and I am getting better bass balance in final mixes using these as a check. Mids and highs seem very accurate. Feel a little tight when you first put them on but that goes away quickly and they are very comfortable in long sessions (and it has been hot here in Texas the last few weeks). Good sound isolation both for mixing and tracking - no more click track all over my acoustic guitar recordings which I was getting with Sony and BayerDynamics &apos;phones. Would have liked a case.
No frills but very functional
Look a little flimsy but feel and sound exccellent
Many competitors at this price point - these are the best</Review>

     <Review>Pros: I wanted to replace my cheap $15 sony mdr v150 for something more serious. First thing, is they are much more comfortable than my sony headphones and are crystal clear! Very pleased with the performance and for the price. You

Cons: The &quot;lack&quot; of bass the headset has is made up for its clarity, so it doesn&apos;t over power anything else in the headset? Haven&apos;t had them long enough to say anything bad.

You would be stupid not to get a great headset like this one! I had ordered it on Monday the day i left for vacation and had received it Wednesday the day i came back! awesome delivery like always!</Review>

     <Review>Pros: These headphones sound amazing - the highs are crystal clear, mids are not muddy or lost, and there is quite a good amount of detail on the lows. They also isolate sound very well. I can barely hear the roaring fans of my PC and my roommates stirring around, with just the headphones on and no sound playing. With music on and low volume, I can hear almost nothing else but my music.

For extended periods of use, these headphones feel pretty comfortable, and they stay on your head securely. They also seem rather durable, which is important because I have broken many pairs of headphones by accident.

Cons: When I first tried them on my PC, I was very disappointed with the sound. It sounded very harsh, like the sound was high pitched and came out of a tin can. Then I did some ... research, and found out that since these headphones have 64 ohms of impedance, they usually require an amplified power source to be driven. Unless you have a Cmoy amp, Fiio amp, or have it hooked up to something independently powered, it will not sound that great. Don&apos;t bother using it on an MP3 player or your PC without any of the aforementioned things.

They are flat response, so all frequencies will come in relatively similarly in respect to volume. This may be good, but it doesn&apos;t add the thumping bass that some headphones do.

They also get a little warm after use, and sometimes pressure builds in your ears. These headphones also feel a bit tight. But taking them off for a little while fixes that problem.

I have been searching for a good pair of headphones that were durable and had clarity and detail. These headphones are a great deal if you can find them at the right price. The Sennheiser HD280 Pro headphones were recommended by a friend, so I found a good deal online and got one. With the right sound equipment, these things will shine! Bass impact is indeed there, but it requires an amp and some EQ&apos;ing to bring out certain frequencies.

I am currently using them with an old RCA 250 watt receiver, as well as a cheap Creative 2.1 sound system. I hook up either the receiver or sound system to my PC, then use the Headphone Out port so that they can power my headphones.

     <Review>Pros: Great audio quality; Inexpensive ($100)

Cons: big

If you are looking for a pair of headphones that will let you enjoy music so much more, then these are the headphones for you to buy. I am an avid traveler so when i go on the plane, i want some peace and relaxation, so i use these headphones. They are good because they block out all of the sound around me and help me feel better. The headphones do not hurt me when i am using them, and i can have them on for hours without them disturbing me. They are also nice because they fold up so i can take them with me when i travel. The ear parts are large, and they fit around my whole hear so that sound does not leak out. The size of the headphone is easy to adjust so i can make it fit my head comfortably. The price is also afford ... able.

     <ReviewTitle>Studio Headphones - NOT for DJ&apos;n</ReviewTitle>

     <Review>Ease of UseThey&apos;re headphones, you plug them in, they work. The oval shape of the cups are for using them the standard way - over your head and not craddled on your shoulder like when you DJ.Quality The build feels good. They&apos;ve been in and out of my bag and have not ripped, chipped, or broken. The sound is really nice and clear. Mides and highs sound great. Lows/Bass is good as long as it&apos;s in the studio or at home. I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND THESE FOR DJ USE OUTSIDE OF THE HOME OR STUDIO. Once you put the volume up really high on a mixer, the bass does not sound so great and it is hard to hear over the crowd and loud music. FeaturesThe cord is a nice length. It comes with a gold quarter inch plug so you can use them on an mp3 player and then add the plug to fit into a mixer. Once you ... put them on, you immediately notice that you can&apos;t hear anything from the outside. I do like that the cups fold in nicely and can be stored away easily.ValueOverall value is good. I&apos;ve had this pair for over a year and they still sound great and have not chipped, cracked, or broken. A good buy for DJ&apos;n at home or use in a studio.

     <Review>Pros: block out other sounds; Great audio quality; Collapsible; Inexpensive ($100); lots of padding

These are a great buy. By no means are they meant to be the best headphones out there, but they are perfect for what they were designed for.

They isolate noise very well and remain fairly comfortable. They sound great. I will note that these headphone benefit greatly from amplification. So either an amp or good source helps tremendously.

In many reviews that I have read(including on other sites), people complain about the lack of bass. If you source has enough power, there is no lack of bass in these headphones.

My only complaint is since theese headphones fit very snug, they tend to get very warm. During the summer I will have to pull them off every once an ... d awhile to let them air out. Otherwise, if my ambient temperatures are cool, the headphones stay comfortable.

Purchased mine in January of 2010, so I have had them for a year now. They still sound perfect and the plastic/rubber headband is still in perfect shape. The ear pads have compressed slightly, but that is to be expected.

     <Review>Pros: Where to begin... Weight-perfect; not so light that they feel weak, not so heavy that they cause neck pain. Sound-Perfect for my tastes (audiophile on a budget with a preference for slightly more bass (I&apos;m also a gamer)); these headphones will allow you to hear EVERYTHING. If you think for a second that the frequency response is not as described, you could not be further from the truth. Size-perfect for my head; the headband is adjustable to fit a wide range of heads. Comfortability-less than perfect, but still close; depending on your head size, after hours use use, you will occasionally need to adjust them because they do squeeze your head a bit hard (only slightly). Cable-very well insulated and very long. Also, I did not buy from Newegg as these were a gift (best audio related gi ... ft ever). That is why I am not a confirmed owner. I have also put several thousand hours of listening time into these headphones, which will factor into this later.

Cons: Cable-very thick due to insulation (not inflexible) which makes it heavy. Also, its being coiled adds to the mass-per-length, making it feel as though someone is constantly tugging on the left cup very lightly.

And here&apos;s where the rant begins... For all you people put there saying you came from skullcandies and other built-for-ipod headphones, these are not bad headphones. They are designed to reproduce sound they same way they are input into the headphones. Your headphones are designed to &apos;tweak&apos; the audio to the bass addicts tastes without getting expensive (if you want expensive, look up Senn&apos;s HD 800s). Trust me on that one, I&apos;ve come off of years with assorted Skullcandies, including the FMJs. They are good at what they are designed to do, but are simply designed for a different listener. Second, let me tell you a little something about burn-in. IT IS ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY FOR ALL HEADPHONES! It also takes a while, so ignore any reviews about any headphones that are made with ownership as anything less than 1 month (unless the review specifically mentions burn-in). Unburned-in headphones do not sound the way they are design to. Designers factor in burn-in. You should too.

     <Review>Pros: Bass is solid and recovers very fast. The highs are clear and crisp. I can tell action sound left to right clearly.

Cons: None.

These headphones are equal to some that cost twice the regular price. Newegg another winner, thanks.</Review>

     <Review>Pros: Audio Reproduction

Cons: Weight

I&apos;ve had these for 5+ years. These are great. They fold up, can be used in every scenario, and they do last.

Only problem I ever had was the top band cushion started peeling after 3 years...fix: pipe insulation and electrical tape: Good as new!

The ear cups are showing signs of age, but still provide a good seal.

Used on a 24-hour HAM Field Day...These worked great! Ham no problems with the other contesters in the room.

Plus is the 1/4&quot; adapter: since it screws on, it makes it hard to loose it.

Great product, great price!

Only thing I might replace these with would be the HD380Pro.</Review>

     <Review>Pros: I see a lot of people saying that these are bulky, heavy, uncomfortable. I don&apos;t know any headphones that are of this quality that are noticeably smaller in size. I don&apos;t think these are that heavy compared to the Bose / Dre Beats. And these headphones I think are super comfortable, I&apos;ve been able to wear them for 4+ hours no problem. 

Quality is superb, and value wise I don&apos;t think you can find more &quot;bang for buck&quot; headphones than these.

Cons: The wire is a 3 - 9ft coiled cable. If you are extend it will have varying degrees of retraction so you gotta have it plugged in to something that can support the weight of the cable. This isn&apos;t really a con I suppose though.

Sennheiser makes great headphones, and these compare to the dre beats / Bose headphones with ... great price! These bad reviews are bunk!

     <Review>Pros: Excellent, crisp sound quality. This is the best audio I have ever heard. Able to hear the vibrations of guitar strings on certain songs. Great ambient noise reduction. They collapse in several ways for flexible storage.

Cons: Nothing major. They fit a bit snug, bit that is probably necessary to reduce ambient noise. Also, the band seems to adjust more horizontally than vertically, but it could just be my fat head. It may take a couple adjustments to get it right. No showstoppers though.

The bass is there, but a tad flat, but these are for professional and quality listening of full-spectrum music. If you are looking for booming bass, seek elsewhere - try open-back/infinite baffle sets, I think they have better bass. Otherwise, the treble is amazing, very clean ... and easy to listen to. If you like a variety of music, these are perfect.

     <Review>Your search stops here, buy these headphones.
The phones aren&apos;t completely noice cancelling, so if you are expecting this they will not deliver. I wanted a pair of phones that would block out ambient noise just enough to hear the ranges of bass and highs and lows that these phones deliver. The cord is coiled and comes with a screw-on tip for fitting into amps, etc. All in all, its the best pair of headphones for the price on the market
Heavy German engineering, comfortable ear cups, extra long cord with a coil for even longer range, nice and beefy look and feel, doesnt squeeze too much on the temple/upper jaw (i wear a 7 1/2&quot; fitted ball cap and they fit perfectly.), completely adjustable, parts can be replaced when they wear down (ear cups, cord, for example). Sennheiser is made in ... Germany so you know its built to last. No cheap plastic on this thing.
You won&apos;t find a better headset for the price. They easily sound better than some of the twice the price pairs I have tried and owned in the past. I bought them to listen to music and use when drumming in the studio, and the closed ear cups make sure that the sound is directed clearly and cleanly so I can stay on tempo. Buy these phones if the price is right, you won&apos;t regret it.

     <Review>Pros: Great Bass
Great Highs
IF connected to an amp, you will get more than what you paid for, I assure you.
Comfortable, Very.
Heavy fabric and great sound insulation (works with heat as well)

Cons: Needs an amp to get the entire package.
Mids seem a little weak compared to the bass and highs.

Overall a great set of headphones, not long after i tried them out, i was out flaunting my new hardware to my buddies. Gotta say, they sound great even without the AMP, and would recommend anyone to buy them.</Review>

     <Review>Pros: These headphones rock!

-Very comfortable (They do feel a bit tight around the head at first but after about 2-3 hours of breaking them in they fit like a glove.
-Even sound reproduction across the audio spectrum
-Crisp, clean bass response (no it won&apos;t rattle your eardrums, but I don&apos;t really want to go deaf!)
-I&apos;ve been able to hear details I hadn&apos;t noticed on mp3&apos;s and cd&apos;s that I&apos;ve had for years; shuffling pages, musicians whispering or breathing, etc. Brings a whole new dimension to the same music.

Cons: -Look incredibly bulky and dorky (but who cares with sound that good!)
-Somewhat heavy
-Price, but then again you get what you pay for! (and hey I got a cool sansa mp3 player with it for free, so it&apos;s cool. :)

When you get them, hook them up t ... o a computer or something that can play music for a long continuous time at pretty high volume (about the loudest you can make them and still stand having them on) and let it sit for about 12 hours - 24 hours. This loosens up the coil inside and creates a noticeable improvement in sound clarity.

     <Review>See my &quot;features&quot; comments. These are some of the best sounding headphones I have ever heard. Nice and clear, plenty of volume and a well balanced sound. They blow my higher-end akg&apos;s out of the water. They isolate pretty good and are comfortable to wear for long periods. No special effects here to make them sound good. Just some really good headphones.
For the price, you absolutely cannot buy a better sounding pair of headphones. Great amount of distortion-free volume available. Good isolation, clarity and detail, even in the bottom end. I love these things! This is my second pair and would never hesitate to buy another pair if and when needed. I have a set of AKG k270 studios and the hd280 blows them out of the water, especially in the bottom end and volume departments.
 top notch&lt; ... br&gt; won&apos;t find better at this price

     <Review>Pros: Great cans for the price (when on sale)! these sound absolutely amazing. plenty of bass and fit my big head just fine.

Cons: none

people saying there is no bass must just have them connected directly to a computer or something. I have a set of Edirol monitor speakers connected via cox to my soundcard. the cans are connected to the edirols (no amp etc) and there is plenty of bass!</Review>

     <Review>Pros: Very comfortable fit, fits around my ears and does not become uncomfortable after long use. The closed design allows for music to be heard fully without having to push the volume dangerously high. The bass response is effective, not the loudest, but is loud enough to definately feel the bass. The high end response never gets painful even at full volumes, so you won&apos;t have to throw these down when drummers go crazy on the cymbals. The cord is built well and the pad on the top of the arch won&apos;t win any beauty contest but it keeps the headphones from feeling uncomfortable. The ability to pivot the earcups is a nice feature and the foldability of the entire design is perfect. Very rugged, easy to clean, they stay secure to your head. The additional screw-on jack is a nice touch, and may ... be a must have for certain people&apos;s applications. Overall a great purchase for music lovers or audio producers who want professional sound at an entry level price.

Newegg got it to me in 9 days, in Iraq.

Cons: No case included. Utilitarian design may turn people away from this, but it is definately not built poorly by any means.

MP3&apos;s do these no justice even at supreme bitrates, MP4, OGG, FLAC all sound so much clearer in comparisson and these headphones will help you hear a lot of nuances in music that you may have been missing.

     <Review>I was looking for a good pair of monitors for mixing and headphones for listening to music on a general basis with great noise isolation. When I first opened the box I was underwhelmed, they sounded good but there was just no bass and they midrange was terrible. I ran them for about 20 hours at half volume for a &quot;break in&quot; period. They really opened up and sound out of this world! Every detail is audible and all frequency bands sound very natural. The construction is tough too! Pick some up. - I think most of the comments on low quality are due to them not being broken in</Review>

     <Review>Frequency response is great, they can handle sub and ultra sonic range when needed.
They have a great fit that is fully adjustable. Frequency response is just what you would expect from such a reputable company. More SPL than you dare use!
All details in construction, performance, and value are surpassed.
Good value, good investment.</Review>

     <Review>Pros: Light weight, i used to use a set of Psyko 5.1&apos;s and these are much much lighter. Great sound, even better when used with a amplifier. Bass hit&apos;s hard without distortion, i couldn&apos;t be happier.

Cons: hi mom

My computer setup is in the living room, my wife and child are obviously deaf and before i got these phones all i could hear was the TV over the music i was trying to listen to. The 32db ambient noise reduction is GREAT. I can no longer hear the disney channel in the background of everything. I can also turn these phones Waaay up, and they cannot hear them. 2 thumbs up!</Review>

     <Review>Pros: These are great headphones. VERY comfortable both on your ears and on the top of your head. Amazing sound. These are NOT tight, and I have a large head. High quality coiled cord. Amazing highs and mids. Downright spectacular compared to my old Creative HN-700&apos;s. Pretty high quality construction, as far as I can tell. I used my Creative&apos;s so much that they broke within 8 months. We shall see whether these live up to the hype...

Cons: They&apos;re a wee bit bass-shy, especially when playing music on something that doesn&apos;t have a decent amp (mp3 players will sound a little low on bass, but these headphones still pump out good quality sound and work just fine with them). I also miss the ability to unplug the cord at the base of the headphones (I used to have two cords, one for my compu ... ter and the other for my iPod). Bottom line on the bass: These are monitoring headphones, not audiophile headphones. With an amp and without using the eq, these sound great, but otherwise the bass is fairly quiet.

There are several gripes that over people have made that aren&apos;t accurate. Headaches caused by these headphones are NOT caused by the tightness. Headaches are caused in people who aren&apos;t used to closed circumaural headphones because of the sealed pressure. Their inner ears haven&apos;t adjusted to sealed headphones, and that can cause headaches. Another issue is with sweaty ears. This is pretty much a &apos;duh&apos; issue. They&apos;re closed headphones, they&apos;re black, and they completely seal the area around your ear. What do you expect?

     <Review>Pros: Durable, portable, sound quality is top notch. Noise canceling due to construction.

Cons: Big. Thats about it.

After trying out cheaper models I finally chose to put forth a little bit more $$ for something that will last, sounds AMAZING and will be used every day. The Sony on the ear headphones were my first choice. Don&apos;t buy from Target as you cant try them out first. Got em home and they SUCKED! Tinny and they DIDN&apos;T cancel noise like they said even with the battery power pack.

Best buy is great because I could try these out before I bought em. The sound quality was AMAZING. These are studio worthy and I can see using these for monitoring vocals if I was recording. I can see a dual use for the future after I learn how to use recording programs for my PC. Also ... a pleasant surprise was they canceled out noise due to the construction. No BATTERIES needed!

Anyway, these do the job, have a nice long cord and are TOUGH! The cord is thick and the ends are meant to take abuse. Although the headphones are a bit LARGE, they rotate flat so I can put them in my backpack pouch. They also fold up into a ball like shape for transport in other size pouches.

As a musician, I can truthfully say that from the music aficionado to the price conscious music student all will be very happy with this purchase. You will hear the mid-range and the highs (for Classical, Pop, Jazz or or Rock) and the BASS BOOMS (Hip Hop or Rap) It ALL sounds great through these headphones. Worth every penny.

     <Review>Pros: Full frequency response, amazing sound quality and clarity, definitely a steal at the $70 I paid and these will help me with producing/mixing/mastering music tremendously.

Provides amazing sound isolation so you can really focus on the audio streaming through them without outside interference, save a bomb going off.

Cons: The only sort of &quot;con&quot; I would say is just a personal preference. I have a lot of music at 24-bit/96kHz, and headphones make even studio-quality music sound &quot;compressed&quot; simply because there&apos;s no air. This isn&apos;t a con of these headphones, I just rather prefer speakers for true fidelity.

Don&apos;t even hesitate to pick these up if you care about quality sound with a full dynamic range, clarity and isolation. I can&apos;t see any need at all to go for anyt ... hing $200+.

     <Review>Pros: Phenomenal sound quality for the price. Great lows / Screeching highs. Comfortable for extended use. When in use the noise levels from outside are minimal at best. I crank these without fear no matter who else in the room, so long as they are on your head they won&apos;t disturb anyone.

Excellent build quality!

Cons: IMO the cord sucks. Its not braided (and really should be at that MSRP) and the coil design is a bother to deal with. Sure it extended to over 9ft, but what good is that if the coil keeps tension on your head, holding you back to the unit. Also, after about 6 ft the coils springy nature has a tendency to pull the plug right out of my PC. But if that&apos;s the only con...

No reason to remove an Egg for the cord. Its only my personal opinion. I know a few of my ... friends love the coil design. So its all just a personal problem that I had to find a way around. 

I use these mainly on my PC. One thing to note is that if you plan to use these with your PC you should invest in a decent sound card with a dedicated headphone port. The front panel headphone ports can&apos;t supply the full range and power needs for these cans, causing some minor distortion. Though they still sound excellent even on front panel. Once again just my opinion.

If you have HD audio built into your PC you can use the green port on the back panel for a distortion free experience at the cost max volume.

One last side note, I pick my pair up at a competing site with a gift card, in case you were wondering why I&apos;m not verified.

     <Review>Highly recommended. I purchased these to use for home recording where clarity, isolation and accurate bass response is of utmost importance. This set filled my needs perfectly and at a great price ! 
These headphones arrived very quickly after placing my order. The feature I like best is the fact all the parts that always wear out are easily replaceable, including the cable. 
I instantly fell in love with the clarity and response. I have read other reviews about lack of bass response but I am delighted with it. Its not boomy (and I didn&apos;t want boomy...), but its there at the right volume and solid. They also provide more than adequate isolation. Couldn&apos;t be happier....
 I had a $20 off coupon which made this an exceptional value..... still a great offering at regular price of $99. ... 95......

     <Review>I use these headphones primarily for listening to my iPhone and for audio mixing. The sound is great. Despite these headphones not being noise cancelling, the do a great job of reducing ambient noise. The bass is clean and the mids and highs are crisp and clear. The only thing that could be improved would be the stage presence. For a [$] pair of headphones though, it would be hard to find better!</Review>

     <Review>Pros: Price

Cons: Cheap plastic

Construction:
I am comparing this to my Ultrasone HFI-780 and other Sennheiser headphones. Material is cheap compared to my Ultrasone. The head band material is the same used on my Sennheiser PX100, after heavey use it will peel. The Ultrasone head band and ear cups are stronger compared to the HD 280. Both have the same grip on my head.

Sound:
Ultrasone S-Logic is wider compared to the HD 280. Sound of the 280 is flat, but this doesn&apos;t mean it lack bass. Depending on what you listen, bass is there. Of course my HFI-780 are heavier on bass.
Need to try both on a headphone amp.</Review>

     <Review>Pros: Very clear, good noise isolation, comfortable and a great price. I&apos;ve tried a LOT of different headphones and these are the absolute best I&apos;ve heard for this price range. I&apos;ve let my friends listen to them as well, funny enough, they went out and bought a set immediately afterwards.
I use them in the office, at home and while traveling. They&apos;re fairly durable and the noise blocking in the airplanes is awesome, especially when there&apos;s a crying baby sitting behind you.

Cons: It&apos;s hard to come up with some cons but here we go:
- The bass is not going to blow you away, however it is deep and clear. If you&apos;re expecting &quot;beats&quot; bass that literally rattles your ears and head, go buy your overpriced sub-par quality headphones.
- looks/styling, they look like cheap headpho ... nes and if you saw them sitting on a park bench you wouldn&apos;t think twice about them
- After wearing them for hours, your hair is pressed down where the band on the top is and around your ears.

I bought them at the sale price, but I would not hesitate to pay full price for them having actually used them. They are well worth full price.
The cord is REALLY long, thankfully it&apos;s a spiral wound cord, but it makes the cord heavy and impractical for active use.

     <Review>Pros: Sound quality for the price. Full over the ear isolation

Cons: Size..and adjustablity. Very stiff out of the box, really need to be broken in, or they WILL give you a headache.
64 Ohm impedance, requires high volume level, to the point that some portable MP3 players wont be able to over come it.

These phones sound good for what they are. The bass is just a tad off down low the mids and highs are great. You would be hard pressed to find a better set of full over the ear headphones in this price range.</Review>

     <Review>I just got these in today and the sound quality is amazing. I must say that at first impression, I thought they were lacking bass. I was comparing the sound quality of the HD 280 to a pair of AKG k240s. As funny as this sounds, my glasses were the problem. I have pretty thick frames. Usually when I montor a mix or listen through headphones I keep my glasses on. With these headphones, the seal around your ears is very important; any type of leakage could alter the sound. As soon as I removed my glasses, all of the bass in the mix was revealed and a huge smile was plastered on my face.
Great sound attenuation. Be warned that if you wear thick framed glasses, the sound quality and attenuation may diminish. If removing your glasses while using these headphones doesn&apos;t bother you, buy them r ... ight away!
At this price you can&apos;t go wrong.

     <Review>I work sound at church. Our worship team is generally made up of drums, keys, electric guitar, acoustic guitar, bass and 3 or 4 vocalists. We rehearse on Mondays and make a recording for the musicians to use throughout the week as they prepare for the Sunday worship service. These headphones are a major upgrade from the Sony MDR-V600 headphones that the church has. I purchased these myself after reading many reviews and I have not been disappointed! They have an excellent flat response and the isolation is incredible. We generally run between 85 and 95 dB in our sanctuary and these allow me to listen and blend the musicians without interference from the sound in the sanctuary. The quality is very good and the price can not be beat!</Review>

     <Review>I&apos;m powering these headphones through my Focusrite Saffire white face FireWire audio interface and they work pretty darn well. Good all-rounders that don&apos;t color the sound too much.Pros - cheap, clear, rugged, replaceable cushioning/wire, left cup only wired, big ear padding, fold up several ways for easy storage. Even when played loud and repeatedly, very little ear fatigue.Cons - grab my head a bit tight but no pain on ears, just able to hear my pulse. Need to be given lots of juice to work properly, so probably not the greatest for iPods.I also have a pair of HD 201s and the comparison is remarkable. The 280s are much clearer and can be driven harder with zero distortion. Also, in terms of construction, the 280s are beyond compare. Solid chord, solid headset. My round town headphones a ... re a $30 pair of in-ear Sonys. Again, no comparison. The Sonys are super bassy and quite muddy in the mids. However, they block out a fair bit of outside sound and are easy to stow, so they&apos;ve got the portability angle. I don&apos;t think I&apos;ll be lugging my 280s around town. Maybe the 201s though.Rated 4 because of the 650s and 800s... Tall about amazing...

     <Review>I&apos;m really growing fond of these cans. The area they accel in is without a doubt tracking. These have great isolation, minimum mic bleed, better than most headphones out there. For the price it&apos;s a steal. Yes they are a bit bright in the upper mids and a little light on the bass, but that makes them good for monitoring and as a mixing cross reference. Though I would not use these for dedicated mixing, there are better open back headphones for that. And also note that there IS a breakin period, I left these playing heavy metal at moderately high volume levels and went to work, came back 9 hours later and they sounded better! much smoother so don&apos;t be turned away by the sound right off the bat. Get these and you won&apos;t regret it!</Review>

     <Review>Pros: Everything. These headphones sound fantastic when listening to music on my old computer or my iPod. Reviewer who mentioned they don&apos;t&apos; work well with mp3 players had me worried -- that was totally not the case. Clarity, bass and mids are unbelievable.

Cons: They are huge and heavy. Not a big deal to me cuz I&apos;m a big guy.

Fantastic Deal - way better than my old Bose headphones that were $40 more.</Review>

     <Review>Pros: Simply outstanding, excellent lows, and highs, mids seem to be lacking but they have to have a mild weakness somewhere don&apos;t they. One of the best sounding headsets I&apos;ve used for the money. Extremely good seal around the ear provides for amazing isolation. The sound quality is out of the world and is sharp were talking honed to a razors edge. I&apos;m a total metal head and these babies are brutal beyond belief when it comes to excellent riffs and bass. I&apos;ve bought more expensive headsets and these things beat it hands down.

Cons: A bit heavy and take some breaking in before they become very comfortable. Again mids are good but not the greatest thing I&apos;ve ever heard.

Excellent impedance on this set of headphones. The only thing I might pick up to add to these babies is an a ... mp, and if your using em on a computer a DAC is a must.

     <Review>Pros: block out other sounds; Great audio quality

If you google around the net, you can find out that this Sennheiser HD280 professional headphones got great expert reviews everywhere, and that&apos;s not a joke. That&apos;s because it really is that good with this headphones based on its price. There&apos;re not that many headphones at this price range to sound as crisp and rich in bass than this headphones. Unless you&apos;re willing to pay for premium with those premium headphones, then this will be a very good choice for its price. It blocks out other sounds because it is a closed ear type of headphones which helps to keep the things you listened to by yourself so no one can hear what you are listening to. It got great audio quality with rich bass for those heavy metal stuffs or crisp and clea ... r sound for those acoustics bunch. The only thing that I can think of as a con is that you have to replace the earpad from time to time as it isn&apos;t as durable as I would&apos;ve liked. The piece of foam is cover in cheap nylon which rips and tears as time went on. So be prepare to replace the earpads if you use this a lot. I would recommend this headphones to anyone looking for a decent headphones for a budget price.

     <Review>Pros: Great sturdy headset, Low-Mid range Audiophile sound. 90% of parts replaceable. Could not ask for better at the same price range. Comfort, extremely comfort once you adjust them and ge them to the right fit.

Cons: None

THESE are not your BASS headphones they don&apos;t artificially increase bass like most other headphones they are &quot;flat line&quot; headphones. What you put in you get out exactly.

If you are not use to high quality sound it can give you some major headaches starting out (my girlfriend complained of it). I had none been listening to high quality sound for years.

one other thing is Burn In the initial burn in takes about a month. took me about 3 weeks or so but that&apos;s using these 8-10 hours a day straight. But your headphones will continue to burn un th ... roughout the rest of their use (granted it is less drastic) My headphone over a year probably a year and half old now created &quot;warmer&quot; sounds then after the first month. Which is great they sound even better

     <Review>Pros: block out other sounds; Great audio quality; Collapsible; Inexpensive ($100); Flat frequency response

Cons: big; Slightly uncomfortable; Plactic cracks

Sennheiser&apos;s HD 280 headphones are a closed, circumaural model notable for their substantial isolation from external noise and relatively balanced frequency response for their price range. The isolation comes at the cost of a potentially uncomfortable pressure from the ear cups, though I became accustomed to the pressure fairly quickly. With a relatively flat frequency response, the HD 280&apos;s lack the booming bass common in many cheap headphones. Advertised for professional use, these headphones are great for anyone looking for an accurate presentation of their source music, without spending a fortume.

After about ... a year of heavy use, cracks appeared in the plastic on each side of the headband. Within a couple more years, the cracks expanded until most of the plastic broke completely off. The headphones remained usable with some modification, but lost significant comfort and isolation. Based on other reviews and comment on the HD 280&apos;s, it seems the cracking plastic is (or at least was) a fairly common problem, though I have not heard of other cases where the headphones broke as a result.

With a regular price of around $100 and sale prices in the neighborhood of $70, the HD 280&apos;s are great headphones for the price, even with the small chance they&apos;ll eventually break with use. I used these headphones for hours a day for years, and enjoyed every minute.

     <Review>Pros: block out other sounds; Collapsible; Great audio quality; Inexpensive ($100); fit big heads; lots of padding

Cons: Slightly uncomfortable

These over-ear headphones are terrific.  They almost completely mute out background noise--you can&apos;t hear yourself talk let alone someone next to you.  That is a good thing when someone is forcing you to listen to the awful radio in the car.  Some people have complained about these headphones squeezing your head to tight, but for me that isn&apos;t a problem and I have a size 7.5 head.  I find the comfort, especially the top band, to be perfect.  The sound quality is outstanding, especially the bass.  I had never used anything but cheap earbuds and was astonished by the difference.  These were recommended to me by my brother who is a bit o ... f a sound snob so I know the quality is great.  The best part about these is the price.   I found these for $70 and they could probably be had for cheaper.  I suppose there are drawbacks, including the size.  But the nice thing is these fold into a nice compact block so they can&apos;t be thrashed around in storage as easily.  I highly recommend these.

     <Review>Pros: Know great sound when I hear it. True I have tinnitus. But had to go for it. Tired of bad $10 headphones I buy 4 times a year. Need a good test? try Lita Ford&apos;s latest album (mp3, cd or vinyl) And put it thru it&apos;s paces :) The brands been in my brain since I was young so when I had the chance to buy one I looked for the one that looked solid. I didn&apos;t buy it for it&apos;s collapse ability. But because it&apos;s retro, coiled and looked like real headphones. Very comfortable and hits great bass. Not ultra low but it&apos;s impressive. And yes don&apos;t have it glued to your head. But safer than ear buds.

Cons: Made in Ireland?? Thought this was from Germany. Was well timed. I got it during the local Irish Fest but it&apos;s a German country. Box is cheap looking. Thats about it.
 ... r&gt;Other than being made in Ireland ... as my title says Are you Kidding? Duh it&apos;s going to get 5/5 maybe 10/5. There is a $150 model at another store local but it feels cheap. So I&apos;m glad I got this one.

     <Review>Pros: +Excellent sound quality! Highs, lows, and incredible bass. Neo magnets bring earthquake explosions to video games and movies. Very clear and crisp sound. I would recommend these to any PC Gamer, late night apartment movie watcher, DJ, recording studio, and anyone that owns an iPod of MP3 player! comes with plug adapter, so it will work with all your electronics. I use them to listen to radio/music/DVD&apos;s on long loud bus ride to work, blocks 80%+ of the background noise. I live on a freeway &amp; airport.. blocks all background noise!

Cons: -huge size, plastic hinges, and I can&apos;t hear my girlfriend when wearing them. wait, is that a con?

I&apos;ve owned many different headphones and these are tied fr first place. The Sony professional series are nice too, but these are ... over $100 less and offer 95% the sound quality. Keep away from the panasonic 40mm and 50mm speaker headphones, they are not in the same class as these. These headphones are deliver what you expect from Sennheiser. Don&apos;t hesitate, buy them and enjoy!

     <Review>Pros: Excellent, excellent sound
Some replaceable parts
Loud playback -- I have trouble finding headphones that I don&apos;t have to run at full volume at all times. These force me to back off a notch or two with some material.

Cons: Somewhat uncomfortable due to the hard pads and high clamping pressure.
The alleged high attenuation of outside noise is not noticeably greater than other phones of this type; maybe less.

I gave these a modest 3 eggs based on price Vs. performance. Sound and comfort weighed equally for me, and I find these to be uncomfortable. I find my older Sonys to have higher external attenuation, lower clamping force, softer pads, and apparently lower weight. I want this sound in my old cans.</Review>

     <Review>Pros: Great sound quality, very comfortable, noise isolation, appropriately long cord, overall fantastic product.

Cons: None so far

People seem to complain about these being too tight, but I can wear them for 6-8 hours a day with no issues at all - they&apos;re fantastically comfortable. Maybe a bit bulky, sure, but that&apos;s the price you pay for good sound quality and over the hear surrounds.</Review>

     <Review>Pros: Probably the best pair of headphones I&apos;ve ever owned. 
Slightly heavy on bass response, but I don&apos;t mind.
The over ear design helps quite a bit in reducing outside noises.

Cons: Not ideal in warm weather.

I&apos;m able to listen to my music at a much lower volume compared to my old headphones because of the increased clarity.</Review>

     <Review>These Headphones are great, well worth the price. The sound isolation is great, Almost like a cone of silence. I use them for everything from field recording to editing. I wear glasses and these are one of the few pairs of headphones that I have tried that don&apos;t hurt after a few hours of marathon editing. The size of the padding is perfect, they sit on my head, not my ears.</Review>

     <Review>Pros: Accurate sound quality without coloring the sound. You can hear almost every minute detail in a song. These headphones are very good on the mids and treble, and have very clean sound. The headphones themselves are quite comfortable and sturdy. I also like the collapsible design and the coiled cord because they make this great for traveling. They are closed designed so the person next to you won&apos;t hear your music. Great quality for the price.

Cons: If you listen to bass-heavy music, you will probably need some equalization. When wearing these headphones for a few hours, they can get uncomfortable due to the clamping pressure of the sets. These cans do not have the great sound stage of open designed headphones, but that is to be expected with most closed designed headphones.
 ... 
I would recommend these anyone who wants great sound quality for a decent price. So far I have used mine for editing and mixing my own music, listening to music on my computer, and listening to my mp3 player. They have performed exceptionally well so far. Sennheiser quality!

     <Review>I recently purchased an electronic drum kit. It was my first foray into the electronic instrument world. I needed a decent pair of headphones that wouldn&apos;t cost me an arm and a leg after spending a sizable amount of cash on my e-kit. I cruised multiple drummers&apos; forums and I found this headset reccomended again and again. After purchase, it&apos;s easy to see why. I&apos;m not sure you&apos;ll find a better headset out there without dropping at least three times as much. I was already familiar with the Sennheiser brand; almost a year ago I bought my fiance a high end set of Sennheiser bluetooth headphones which she adores; says they&apos;re the best headphones she&apos;s ever owned, bluetooth or otherwise.

That just carries over to these. They really are excellent for e-drumming or at your PC or stereo; the ... y do very well pulling out out each channel individually.
Honestly not sure what &quot;features&quot; you need to rate on headphones beside their sound quality. And for the modest price these headphones sell for in comparison to some of the DJ or higher end headphones out there, they&apos;re right up there. 
They&apos;re solid, don&apos;t move around on my head while drumming vigorously or getting too into the music to which I&apos;m listening.
For the cost I&apos;m pretty sure these can&apos;t be beat.

     <Review>Pros: Nice appearance, nice fit over the ears if your ears are small.

Cons: The headband was not well padded and too straight for a good fit for most heads. The bass was very poor*. To obtain a proper fit for my ears, I had to position the headband so far back that the weight would make it fall off the back of my head.

Sennheiser has a great reputation and I love my older pair (450), which needs new pads, cushions and cord.

*Another reviewer mentioned the bass issue and Sennheiser said that it was an issue that could be corrected. I contacted them but their cust. serv. response was too slow and missing their call, I called back yet Sennheiser hasn&apos;t yet contacted me.

I am assuming the poor bass was a fluke and I got a pair with the same bass problem as the other ... customer. I don&apos;t think the poor bass response was a realistic representation of these phones, especially with the many reviews praising the good bass response.

I was disappointed in the headband, which put too much pressure on the center of the top of my head and the earcup shape that required me to position the headband to the back of my head yet wouldn&apos;t stay in place. 

The combined issues were too much for me to tolerate even though at $59, the sale price was exceptional if the bass issue was correctable.

     <Review>These headphones sound amazing, especially in the mid and high frequency range. I don&apos;t know of any headphone under $100 that provides better reference sound. Lots or professionals use this headphone to mix recordings and DJ for events. For consumer use, they really bring out detail that goes unnoticed and unheard on regular (translation: affordable) speakers or headphones. It&apos;s delightful, for example, to hear all the little intricacies of Johnny Greenwood&apos;s guitarwork and distortion on Radiohead&apos;s Amnesiac. The bass isn&apos;t overpowering, so if you&apos;re looking for a pair of headphones that really accentuate the bass, you should keep looking. I read in another review that you can feel the bass before you hear it. I didn&apos;t know what that meant exactly until I tried these out. You can h ... ear all the bass in the source, but it won&apos;t overpower and drown out the mids or highs. Other reviews mentioned problems with the construction being flimsy. The construction seems very sturdy in my regular use. Other reviews mentioned that straight out of the box, these headphones don&apos;t sound great, that you need to burn them in. I burned them in by playing my iTunes library for about 36 hours on medium volume and they sounded awesome. The cord is coiled in the middle and can stretch about 10 feet. You&apos;ll want to make sure that nothing rubs against the outside of the earcups or against the cord, if it&apos;s pulled taut to the headphones, because it causes loud distracting noise in the earcups. Overall, a great performing headphone for the money, highly recommended if none of the above bothers you.

     <Review>After getting it out of the box and listening to it I was pretty disappointed. The highs and mids were extremely present and the low end was next to nothing. But after running an Ipod through them for about a day, morning to the evening. The low end sounds much more pronounced. I didn&apos;t believe the comments about breaking them in but it really does work and makes them sound better. It still doesn&apos;t have the most kicking bass in the world. If your looking for mixing with them or monitoring they are wonderful due to it&apos;s flat frequency response. Worth the money I think.</Review>

Cons: None.

An inline volume control would have been nice, but it&apos;s no deal breaker. A much better sounding and constructed headphone set than the steelseries which I bought previously purchased and deeply regret.</Review>

     <Review>Pros: Great price, with this price, you can not find anything better than this far as i know. I have a lot of Sennheiser, from PCs, PXs, MXs, to HDs. I have a HD 598. Of course this headset is not close to HD 598, again, for the price, it definitely worth it.

Highs and mids are accurate and as expected
lows really dive deep, but not too strong.
A little bit muffled, still not sure if that&apos;s because I don&apos;t listen a lot and it still need to be burned.

Cons: As mentioned, muffled, compared to something tripple the price(HD 598)

For less than $80, it worth it!!</Review>

     <Review>Pros: Clear sound and very comfortable. Cord is long enough plus it stretches so that is a plus. 
.
You cant beat the price.

Cons: Plastic pieces that connect earmuffs to the arch are kinda thin and cheap looking.</Review>

     <Review>The headphone itself is well constructed and projects quality as well as sturdiness. Since it is a closed-in headset, it is a nice way to block out the outside world and be in your own world when enjoying your music. As far as sound is concerned, I&apos;m a little disappointed because of the lack of bass and clarity of the highs. Notes that falls in the midrange are ok but other than that there are better headphones out there that is a tad more cheaper or expensive than this one.</Review>

     <Review>Pros: Very clear detail in the highs. Very comfortable, fold up nicely, long coiled cord. These Headphones cancel noise like crazy. Can really pick out various instruments and such.

Cons: Little to no bass*. What bass they do put out is clear though. I should have known this was going to be the case going into buying these. Shouldn&apos;t have gotten closed ear headphones in the first place but nevertheless the bass is almost none existent.

*Disclaimer: I am a bass addict, I often listen to music solely for phat bass lines, thumping bass and massive wobbles.

The contrast between these and my z-2300 speakers is night and day. The z-2300 has overpowering bass and the 280&apos;s little to none... sigh</Review>

     <Review>Pros: The sound quality of these is excellent, basically what I&apos;ve expected from Sennheiser for the past 30 years. The construction of these is equally excellent. The ability of the earcups to fold or rotate as needed makes them easy to store and transport. They are very solidly made and durable.

Cons: The weight might be an issue for some though for circumaural, the weight is not unusually high, in my opinion. The biggest issue personally is that the headband clamps pretty tightly to your head. The padding on the earcups is adequate but the pressure is not adjustable in any way and after an hour or so it can become uncomfortable.

If you&apos;re after mobility or really long listening sessions, you might want to go after something lighter and less substantial but for sound quality ... , these are excellent.

     <Review>Pros: -- Incredible value during Black November sale. This could have been a Christmas gift for everyone I know.
-- Rich, clear sound covering the full spectrum from brain-thumping lows to sparkling highs. These are the best-sounding headphones I&apos;ve ever owned.
-- Full-ear enclosures completely snuff out any sound from the outside world. My fiancee hates me when I&apos;m wearing these.
-- Tightly wound cord doesn&apos;t flop all over your desk.
-- Extremely lightweight. I&apos;ve worn these for hours with no fatigue.

Cons: -- Extremely tight-fitting out of the box. They feel secure, which is a good thing, but it&apos;s noticeable pressure on your cranium.

I&apos;ve been using a Sennheiser on-ear headset (w/ mic) for the last six or seven years. Jumping to the these is like the difference ... between listening to cassettes vs. CDs. Unbelievable sound. Wish I could wear them all day. :P

     <Review>Pros: Excellent bass reproduction, excellent treble clarity. Handles volume very well (very little distortion). Amazing with games, music, movies, and television. Long, sturdy cord and they fit like a dream (after a few days of a break-in period). I can wear them for HOURS and never have aching ears afterward.

Cons: None.

I have been through MANY headphones of all styles. This is by far the best set of headphones I have ever owned. I have had them for 3 years now, and they are still as comfy and amazing as the first time I listened to music with them and went &quot;wow these are amazing&quot;. Buy a pair. Now.</Review>

     <Review>Pros: These are &quot;natural&quot; headphones. That is, they produce sound as it was recorded. Most cheaper headphones (and some professional ones) have bass-boosting elements or otherwise which modify sound within the actual unit. These Sennheisers, however, do not do this. Some may view this as a con (metal heads, etc) but I see this as a plus; you hear what your favorite bands (or their studio mixers) wanted you to hear.

Very durable design and construction (made in Ireland, not China!)
Cord is very sturdy, well attached, and is even replaceable with some deconstruction.
Comfortable to wear after several hours.
Able to play a wide range of sounds/types of music equally well. (Advantage of &quot;natural&quot; headphones).

Cons: A little on the large side, but I wouldn&apos;t dare tak ... e them out of my apartment in fear of damaging them, so this is not an issue anyways.

Since these are closed cup headphones, they cannot be as good as open ear ones. This isn&apos;t really a con since you are trading in quality for privacy (especially good for when you have roommates), but Sennheiser does make open ear headphones with better sound quality.

These headphones are for audiophiles only! 
If you don&apos;t care about high-end sound quality and listening to music the way it was meant to, do not buy these headphones! Go for the Bose instead; they are similarly priced and have Bose&apos;s bass boosting technology that some love and others hate.

     <Review>These sound crystal clear and capture plenty of highs and lows. Be careful because they are not only very loud, they completely encapsulate your outer ear creating almost a vacuum seal. That, coupled with their power can easily damage your eardrums.</Review>

     <Review>Pros: -Fidelity. Everything is perfect clear. If you want to pick a certain instrument out of the background, these headphones are great. Just listening to songs you knew inside and out is a different experience. Also makes listening to choral pieces (as well as duets) incredibly satisfying. I&apos;ve also had very good experiences with IDM and technical classical pieces.
-Warm low and mid ranges. Feels almost earthy, in a good way.
-Sound insulation. You won&apos;t hear anything around you at all if you have music blasting. They leak a little bit of sound, but not much.
-Comfort. You can wear them for hours at a time. They clamp lightly and won&apos;t leave your ears sore.

Cons: -Take a while to break in. Out of the box they sound good, but the highs are a bit weak.
-Large. They fold ... flat, but it&apos;s still a con. Also makes you look a wee bit silly.
-Everything that comes with all circumaural headphones. Other products in the price range would probably have a larger soundstage, for instance.
-You realize how much your music collection sucks. These headphones will make you dig around for FLAC versions of all your favorite songs.

Very good all around product that you can&apos;t really go wrong with.

     <Review>Pros: I&apos;ve had many headphones placed over my ears, and these by far are the best for the price. They give a nice flat response so they are great for movies and music. You hear what a movie director wants you to hear. Or you can hear what a music producer wants you to hear, with dead on accuracy. These headphones don&apos;t add any extra flavor where it doesn&apos;t belong. You hear what was meant to be heard without extra bass or other jargon. 

I use them for video games as well, and they have a dynamic sound way over what you might expect. But this also brings up a very important point with these headphones. If you don&apos;t have a nice receiver, or sound card, or any other music device, then you wont get why you paid so much for these headphones. If you have some good hardware then you will k ... now right away where your money went and why you paid what you did.

Another thing to note here is that I&apos;m a big guy with a large head and these headphones still manage not to touch my ears. This is a huge p

Cons: They need decent hardware to drive them. If you are just plugging them into an iPod then you are wasting your money and time. Find a device that at least has a Burr Brown DAC and these headphones will amaze you.

I&apos;ve heard some people say these headphones lack the bass they want. The main reason isn&apos;t because they cant handle it... it&apos;s more along the lines that they are a flat response monitor headphone setup. You are hearing what you where meant to hear and not a penny more or less. If this still bothers you and you want more out of them they are more than capable. You just need to have a good enough EQ to boost what you want to hear, so you can flavor the headphones to what you prefer.

     <Review>... So Good.I&apos;ve owned Sennheiser before and love their stuff. But, after years of owning my last pair, it was time to purchase a new pair of headphones. That being said, I was really hesitant about ordering this model [HD280 Pro] . But, after a lot of shopping around, my only resolve was to just bite the bullet and buy the HD280 Pro. Why? Well, Price-wise, this is the best for the money. I generally don&apos;t like the Sony&apos;s [in this price range] because they have tendency to add bass to what I&apos;m hearing. If I want more bass, I&apos;ll ask for it. Yet, the Beyer-Dynamics were still out of range for what I needed in budgetary concerns, and they didn&apos;t have a model that compares to the HD280 Pro without adding some heft to the price tag. [Not that this a bad thing. I believe in paying for q ... uality, if it is in fact what you&apos;re getting for the money you spend. I would never be cheap when it comes to certain things, unless the cheaper item is actually very good for the money. This purchase was based on quality, dollar amount and prior satisfaction of using Sennheiser products.]I looked at other models, of course. But, most of those were not offering some of things I wanted, one way or another. The only way I could possible get what I wanted in a Headphone was to go up in price and that simply wasn&apos;t feasible at this time of this purchase.These are really comfortable. When you put them on, you&apos;ll barely hear anything, but when you start playing music, recording, etc. You won&apos;t hear a thing. [You may want to keep an eye on your phone light, cause you&apos;ll miss calls.]It took a short while to burn them, and it has been pleasing to my ears. I can hear some really good detail. With Flat EQ, the recording sounds like it should [to me, purely subjective]. The construction appears to be fine. I haven&apos;t owned them long enough to witness this &quot;cracking plastic&quot;. About the only thing I wish they didn&apos;t do was the coiled cable [I like the concept of them, I just don&apos;t like having to deal with them.]. Then, with the fact that they cord is permanently attached to the left ear piece. I like it when you can unplug them to replace the cable. I once had to use Sennheiser Tech support. It was fine. I called in, I told them what was up, and they sent me a replacement part right away, under warranty of course.I say, don&apos;t expect much for your bucks and you&apos;ll be grateful you bought these for that price. If you have the budget to go high-end, then do it. But, I think if you do a little investigation of your own, you&apos;ll find that these are sweet spot Headphones in terms of dollar and quality.

     <Review>Pros: These are really great sealed monitor headphones. Meaning, they have very good (for low/mid cost headphones) sound reproduction. They are intended to accurately and clearly reproduce the entire audio range, and so they will have much less bass than headphones intended for casual music listening. You can easily use an eq to adjust as desired, however. These headphones are really best at accurately reproducing sound in a noisy environment - you can clearly hear all frequency ranges, from low to mid to high, even at a loud room, crowd, etc.
These also have rotating and folding earcups, making them fairly portable/compact. The cord is user-replaceable (although you need a special cord and must remove the earcup for cord replacement). The headband padding and earpads are replacea ... ble.

Cons: They have a rather strong grip on your head, which isn&apos;t terribly uncomfortable, but is tight. Other reviewers have said this loosens up over time. People wanting &quot;normal&quot; headphones to just listen to music will probably be disappointed with this, especially if using a player without any EQ - the frequency response will be much &quot;flatter&quot; than other headphones (however, the sound will be much clearer at all ranges).

If you need very accurate full-range audio reproduction, especially in a noisy environment, these are for you. In non-noisy environments, open headphones are probably a better bet (but those leak audio to people around you, and let environment noise in). Finally if you are just looking for good headphones to listen to music with and do not want accurate full-range audio reproduction, you should not get these. Get some bass-heavy closed headphones that are intended for music listening.

     <Review>I&apos;ll start off by saying that I don&apos;t have a lot of experience mixing audio but I&apos;m fairly discerning and discriminating when it comes to audio. I am NOT, however, a user of &apos;high end&apos; head phones so I can&apos;t accurately compare these to $400+ cans.That said, I got these on sale and I couldn&apos;t be happier.design:Big. Over the ear isolation. They are a bit tight for my big mellon but I suspect they&apos;ll stretch out eventually. The do, however, do a great job of noise isolation. Typical noise levels are completely obliterated even when the head phones are off. Robust conversation in the same room is just a whisper. Today I noticed I could hear the TV with the volume off, but it&apos;s easily [perceivably] half as loud as normal. The rule of thumb is a doubling of percieved volume requires a 10 ... x increase in power [wattage] so assume a 50W output sounds like 5W from my experience. I haven&apos;t used them in a high volume environment though. I suspect you&apos;ll clearly hear PA noise but it should be significantly attenuated.Sound:Amazing. This is by far the best pair of headphones I&apos;ve ever heard. I&apos;ve been running through tracks to gauge the sound. Bass is tight. I don&apos;t perceive a lack of mid though they did come alive with a bit of EQ tweaking. The highs are bright but not too harsh.I have heard innumerable new nuances since I&apos;ve had the cans. Dark Side of the Moon, Track One.. I can hear what is either Port Hiss or a rattle in the studio while they are recording the &apos;heart beat&apos;. I was listening to another track tonight and I could hear the timbre and resonance of a drum hit which proceeded a pause.. I&apos;d never heard that before on any audio system. That drum resonance was so long and clear I thought it was a Bass Guitar note held until I listened closely.I have noticed a &quot;sizzle&quot;, but I haven&apos;t isolated that yet. It may be the S/N of my hardware or the recordings I&apos;ve been using. It does seem present in everything I&apos;ve tried so far though. It&apos;s audible at higher volume when the audio tracks are silent. It blends out though, even at low levels.Bottom Line:I&apos;m not sure about regular price, but if you catch them on sale grab them. I think they&apos;re great all around mid-range Cans. The Noise Isolation is Good. The sound is Good. They are well designed (they fold like origami). I totally glad I grabbed them up because I&apos;ll be flying to Spain in a few months and they&apos;ll be perfect for an obnoxiously long plane ride.

     <Review>You ever plug a set of headphones into the mixer while you&apos;re playing, dial in your sound and then later go back and listen to the track and think, it didn&apos;t sound like that before. That&apos;s because you&apos;re using DJ or Hi-Fi style headphones. They pump up the bass and scoop out the mids and boost the highs. These WON&apos;T do that.I&apos;ll be the first to tell you, don&apos;t mix with headphones but for detail listening, working at the synth rack or plugged into your guitar rig late at night, these things are pretty darn flat sounding.I&apos;ve got a rather large cranium and I find that they&apos;re a little on the tight side but they fit around the ear nicely and isolate very nicely. I guess if they didn&apos;t fit snug, they couldn&apos;t isolate quite as well. They&apos;re rugged. Even the cable is the thicker stuff...not like ... the iPOD style cable.The padding is nice, they collapse and fold up and seem very durable. A 2 year warranty but I haven&apos;t had to test that yet. I&apos;ve had them for a week now.Very pleased for the price.

     <Review>Pros: I originally got these headphones because I needed a pair of stereo headphones to experience the full benefits of binaural rhythms. These were the best quality pair I could find for the price, and I don&apos;t regret my decision at all. Full five eggs.

I&apos;ve had the headphones for over half a year now, I think. They are very rugged, haven&apos;t shown a sign of wear yet, and the parts are easily bought and replaced for do-it-yourself repairs. Two year limited warranty seals the deal nicely, double that than what I&apos;ve seen for comparable headphones.

Cons: The size, but that is to be expected to be honest, I hardly count it.

Get these headphones if you&apos;re serious about audio quality but don&apos;t want to put a dent in your wallet.</Review>

     <Review>Pros: Great highs and lows, deep bass, awesome sound quality all around.

Very well constructed, sturdy.

Adjust and fold nicely.

Comes with a 3.5mm to 1/4&quot; adapter.

Cons: Clamp tight to head... you may get a headache after wearing these for some hours.

The heavy insulation means your ears will get hot.

Bass isn&apos;t too heavy... there&apos;s better headphones our there for nu-metal and hip hop.

Originally I had bought these headphones from Sam Ash for my electronic drumset, but they have since become my go-to headphones for everything from casual music listening to gaming. I would recommend these headphones to anyone at Newegg&apos;s price.

One thing I&apos;ve discovered is that these headphones are great for competitive FPS play, since the lows come ou ... t so clear. I&apos;m going to have to get a laptop microphone to replace my $30 headset - who would want to go back to inferior audio with a pair of headphones like these?

     <Review>Pros: I love the curled cord, great folding mechanism, sound is pretty good(see comments below. A person can use the head phones as desktop speakers.

Cons: 6 months later my right speaker shutters at some frequencies, so i&apos;m sending them back.

I&apos;ve used about 4 headphones in 10 year period, everything from 5.1 headphones on down, and by far these are the best ones yet. But on the flip side i&apos;m not completely happy with them. i wish the sound was more full. the highs are great and the base is decent. but its really missing the mids. 
The search continues for the best headphones. but these arn&apos;t bad for their price. and the pros stated above really are great features.</Review>

     <ReviewTitle>Great headphones for audiophiles and casual listeners alike</ReviewTitle>

     <Review>I&apos;m no audiophile, but I read the opinions of audiophiles all over the internet carefully when searching for a good set of headphones for everyday use. The Sennheiser HD-280 Pro were the consensus best pick in the price range, and since I got them for much less a couple of years ago, I&apos;ve enjoyed my purchase immensely. I don&apos;t use headphones often, but when I do, I&apos;m always surprised by how crisp and clear the sound is on these cans. All ranges are balanced, and the around-the-ear design of the earphones really helps to block out outside sound. Overall these headphones are perfect for my style of use; I&apos;ve debated getting another pair, but it doesn&apos;t look like these Sennheisers will be dying anytime soon, so I think I&apos;ll be good until then.</Review>

     <Review>Pros: Solid construction, comfortable, passive noise canceling (good seal), decent lows with detailed highs.

Cons: Price. EXCEPT...

...for some reason the price was jacked up here. I bought these same headphones two years ago and spent $80. From newegg. It&apos;s even documented in my order history. No lie.

Anyway, after hearing them and breaking them in, I&apos;d still recommend these headphones at this price. They&apos;re great and are really durable with regards to physical construction and audio driver build. I&apos;ve used these in all applications from normal listening to all night DJing, they always deliver.</Review>

     <Review>Pros: Pristine sound quality. Durable design. Did I mention they sound awesome?

Very nice headphones

Cons: Lacking in Bass/lows. I listen to a lot of indie/alternative rock music and for me it didn&apos;t deliver very well in terms of the lows. 

After wearing a while (4-5 hours) they give me a headache because of the pressure on my head.

Bought for 99.99 right before Christmas of last year. I&apos;m very happy I got them for 1/2 the price they are now.

I originally purchased these for my father but he also agrees they don&apos;t have enough bass. I&apos;ll be picking up a set of grado&apos;s (as mentioned in other reviews) for him and I&apos;ll take these.</Review>

     <Review>I almost always prefer in-ear headphones, but when I need to listen something in a noisy environment, I found Senheiser HD280 is the right thing for me. It&apos;s big and a little heavy, but I think it&apos;s still comfortable to wear since it&apos;s quite soft. Anyway, it&apos;s much better than using a pair of in-ear headphones and try to cover your ears with your hands.It&apos;s kind of big for travelling, but I think the pleasure it brings to enjoy music in crowded restaurants is worth the bother.

I don&apos;t have trained ears, so the main reason that I love Senheiser HD280 is its excellent job in isolating outside sounds. It&apos;s also comfortable to listen, with smooth and clear sound quality. I don&apos;t know how to rate its sound quality in a more professional way, but I would say for casual listeners like me, ... it should be all satisfying in terms of sound quality. It&apos;s price is nice, too. I also admitted that I love it partly because it&apos;s Senheiser, a brand of which I&apos;ve heard mostly positive comments.

     <Review>Pros: Amazing Bass
Amazing Mid
Amazing Highs
I couldn&apos;t believe how different music sounded when I put these headphones on for the first time.
They are very comfortable. I can listen to them for hours without pain. The padding is not hard leather feeling, it&apos;s like pillows.
You can hear things that you never heard in music before... I don&apos;t think I will ever go back to cheap regular headphones (I don&apos;t know if that is a pro or a con :D)...

Cons: Hmm if I had to come up with one... It costs a lot. But if you think about it, you get what you pay for with headphones, but these were well worth the coin for me. I loved them so much that I bought myself a set of them (The first pair I bought as a gift for my girlfriend).

Newegg was awesome with this transaction. The ... day after I purchased the first set of headphones, they went on sale $20 cheaper with a promo code. I contacted NewEgg via instant chat and they credited my PayPal account after the transaction was final.

     <Review>Pros: For the quality, theses are the least expensive decent quality closed headphones you can buy. They also stay on your head pretty well and are comfortable. They are slightly muddy sounding in the bass, but only slightly. The bass response is good down to around 30Hz.

Cons: Look silly if you use them in public, but who cares. You can get better open headphones for the price but you need a quite place to use them and will annoy others around you. For closed headphones, these are a good value.

Someone mentioned &quot;burn-in&quot; here. That&apos;s completely false. Ask them to cite any proof, the only &apos;proof&apos; is anecdotal and is most likely the result of a placebo effect. However, there is actually a study where someone tested a pair of high-end headphone before and after a burn- ... in. He injected flat-band noise and measured the response of the headphones. After 6 days of continuous burn-in, there was no change in the measured response. Even the manufacturers officially state the headphones are not designed to have a &quot;burn-in&quot;. Email them, call them, ask them. They may have been confused as SOME higher end subs do need to be burned in, but the manufacturers released detailed burn-in instructions. As a scientist and engineer, I am offended by people who make such ignorant claims.

     <Review>With their great sound-blocking, these are excellent for recording sound in the field. They are not, however, detailed enough for dedicated post work. They&apos;ll work in a pinch and perform well for the price, but just don&apos;t have the frequency response for editing and sound design. But, that&apos;s not what they&apos;re for. They do an excellent job at their assigned task: monitoring recording.</Review>

     <Review>Pros: Great sound, if properly used.

Cons: Finding an external sound card to accept the 1/4&quot; plug. After 5 years of use I had the plastic band warrantied as it started to crack and chip due to the size of my head and it cracked again.

These need extra power for the bass. Just plugging these into a sound card isn&apos;t enough and will give you poor bass results like so many are reporting. Devices/sound cards that accept the 1/4&quot; plug will give you the proper results you are looking for as the 1/8&quot; usually just don&apos;t have enough &quot;oompf.&quot;</Review>

     <Review>Pros: Everything.

Cons: Nothing.

I&apos;ve had a pair of these head phones for over 3 yrs. now and they still sound amazing. The highs and lows are very crisp and clear.

The only thing that&apos;s happened with mine is the plastic coating around the earpieces are tearing. But to me, that&apos;s not that big of a deal. It doesn&apos;t affect the sound quality or the level of comfort. It&apos;s more of an aesthetic thing than anything else.

Overall, this is a GREAT set of headphones.</Review>

     <Review>I use my headphones mostly at night when listening to music so I don&apos;t bother my roommate. The sound from them is very good for the price. I don&apos;t have any experience using very expensive headphones (over $250) so I can&apos;t compare these to the top-of-the-line pairs. I can tell you that these are very noticeably better than a cheap pair. Good value buy.</Review>

First of all, one person on here has no clue what they&apos;re talking about. I got these to mix live sound and to use in the studio. I also use the when listening to my ipod at night. They&apos;re some of the most comfortable headphones I&apos;ve ever worn. There;s a reason why they&apos;re one of the most used pair of headphones in Pro Audio. Overall, they are an excellent pair of phones. The only thing I would like is a case or pouch to carry them in. oh well, they&apos;re great!</Review>

     <Review>Pros: Extremely good sounding, and well balanced. Crisp, clean, natural sounding highs, smooth mids, and present, tight, clean low end. If the sound source you are plugged into can produce the low end, these headphones can re-produce them. The REALLY low end you can almost feel!

Cons: Not comfortable for long periods. I wish the foam that surrounds your ears were thicker so the inside of the phones would be held away from your ears. The cartilage of my outer ears get sore after about an hour of wearing these.

This unit is durable. I&apos;ve had them for about 3 years now, and my kids use them also. The vinyl/leather surrounding the foam has started to wear out, but after 3 years of pretty heavy use, I&apos;d say that&apos;s good. Plus, you can get replacement foams from Sennheiser.</Review>

These headphones are absolutely the best for studio recording. The frequency response is practically flat! I have used them all and unless you just have a ton of money to throw away these combine the features and durability of much more expensive headphones and are a smart purchase.</Review>

     <Review>I use these for critical listening and they work great! The sound is crisp and I can hear details in the music I&apos;ve missed for years. For the price, they can&apos;t be beat! I got them on Cyber Monday for [$] and I can honestly say there isn&apos;t a better set of headphones for that price out there! After 24 hours or so of burning them in, they opened up even more. They are a little tight on the head at first, but after the first 5 hours or so I didn&apos;t even notice them on my head. Sennheiser gives you a 2 Year Warranty for broken parts, and even after the warranty expires, its really easy to find/replace parts (like the ear cushions). I would recommend these to anybody on a budget that wants really nice and detailed sounding cans. They might not compete with the $400-$500 sets, but I could NEVER sh ... ell out that much money in the first place for headphones.

     <Review>Pros: Comfortable earcups, coil connection cable with more professional look, three day shiping to my door.

Yet it&apos;s not a thousand dollar headphone but overall I am very pleased with the HD280 Pro performance. Sound quality is top knot in term of instruments separation, tight bass but overly artificial reproduced.
Treble is smooth and there is no metalic sizzling overly high-extended.

Thank you Newegg for the good price that I can afford the HD280 pro without paying full MSRP.

Cons: Nones

Next order with Newegg will be the HD550 when in stock.</Review>

     <Review>I think the HD 280 are good headpjones. They have limits as well, but here we are talking about headphones that cost less than 100 euros/dollars. So, you expect limits. The good: nice and flat frequency response (although not below 80/100-Hz). Incredible ambient noise reduction (Sennheiser claims -32-dB, I don&apos;t know whether this is true but they certainly reduce the noise a lot). Very nice sound in general. The bad: a bit unconfortable if you wear them for long times (remember they are closed-back). Perhaps, someone would complain about the absence of bass below 80-Hz (but this is not my case). In conclusion, good (if not even perfect) if you need to work with sounds in a noisy environment. Otherwise, look for an open headphone that may give you extra-bass response and that could be more ... confortable to wear. The 5 stars are because they are exactly what I was looking for (I work in a noisy environment).

     <Review>I have several of this headphone for use in video editing and on-location. I have been very satisfied. In fact, I&apos;m about to buy another one. I like the high isolation performance, which enables me to hear the actual audio signal, even in high noise environments. I also think that the accuracy of the audio produced is very satisfactory. My one concern, born out by about five years usage, is that they are not as robustly built as they could be. I think every set I have has had some piece of plastic break off. So far, none of the breakage has caused a failure. I&apos;ve learned to wrap the head bands on each side of the padding with black gaffers tape. This aside, I think these headphones perform very well, and are a good value. I recommend them.</Review>

     <Review>Pros: These are the best headphones that I have purchased, though they are may first high quality set. I wouldn&apos;t exchange them for anything. The sound is crisp and clear. They are fairly light weight (I have forgotten I had them on).

Cons: These are not for the bass enthusiast. There is not a lot of bass compared to other cheap headphone set I have owned. These were made for the professional audio engineer, not the average head-banger. Some tweaking with the equalizer in you audio software can fix this.

The first language in the instruction manual is actually German. This surprised me, though it shouldn&apos;t as they were made by a German company.</Review>

     <Review>Pros: These Sennheiser headphones are absolutely amazing. The sound quality is perfect. I can now hear every single detailed sound in every song no matter what genre. They provide good bass, but it&apos;s not over the top, and you still get this great sound clarity. They are also really comfortable to wear around for long periods of time, and the coiled cord is great, so you can walk around with these monsters still plugged in. I owned a pair of Bose Tri-Ports, then some Skullcandy&apos;s before these, and they don&apos;t even compare. Definitely worth the price, a great buy. Great quality and sound.

Cons: These things are monsters, they are really big, and they are a tad heavy if you are used to wearing ear-buds all the time. These are still comfortable though, they have great padding, so really ... not a con to be found on these.

Newegg is amazing as usual. Only place I shop for electronics now pretty much. UPS shipping is wonderful as well, always get everything on time.

     <Review>Pros: Super clear and crisp sound, while at the same time drowning out nearly everything else. I really couldn&apos;t ask for more. It really helps when your roommate likes to let the TV go for hours and hours at a high volume, and he&apos;s always making tons of noise.

Cons: They&apos;re a bit tight on your head, which in retrospect isn&apos;t that big of a con. That, and after long periods of time, you can start to sweat a little bit under the plastic/rubber earpiece covers.

I would buy them again in a heartbeat. Truly amazing sound quality for the price. Radiohead never sounded so good :)</Review>

     <Review>Pros: Fits snug and comfy on my head. I can wear these for several hours before taking them off for a bit of a breather.
Has great audio clarity for the price.
Great build quality- not cheap or fragile feeling.

Cons: None!

The wire&apos;s length is up for debate. While these will be longer for a desktop set up, those who have a studio will definitely want to buy these if you need to walk around your work area.</Review>

     <Review>I use these Sennheiser HD 280 Pros for videography and sound editing. For the price these are one of the best. Durable and sound great. The only headphone that comes close in this price range are the Sony MDR7506s, which aren&apos;t as well constructed (though I admit are a tad more comfy)</Review>

     <Review>Pros: Very comfortable headphones that sound amazing. My previous pair of headphones, a gaming headset, was very uncomfortable to have on for more than an hour, but these headphones at times feel almost non-existant. The sound quality is great. Nice, clean and crisp, and enough bass when they need to have it. The long, coiled cord is a must have on any headphones. I wont be buying another pair that doesnt have it. The capability to have both a 3.5mm and a 6.3mm jack is nice, not to mention they&apos;re gold plated for best conductivity. Another nice feature for travel is the ability to fold up into a more compact size.

Cons: None really. Not the top of the line sound, but for the price they&apos;re at, can&apos;t really complain.

Paired with my Creative X-Fi Soundcard, these headphones are ... amazing for music, movies, games, anything.

     <Review>Pros: The only thing i find better than the fantastic quality, is the unbelievable durability. I&apos;ve owned mine for over 2 years and the only sign of stress is a bit of wear on the padding on the headband, which is not only common in all headphones but extremely cheap to replace. they are just well built and sturdy headphones that retain their great quality for years if taken care of.

Cons: The only con i can think of is they can be kind of stiff for the first month or two, but after a few months they wear a bit to better fit your head. within a year after owning them I could game for hours with no discomfort. 2 years into ownership and I can be on the computer literally ALL day (10+ hours is not uncommon for what i do) with no discomfort whatsoever. And i do have glasses.</Review>

     <Review>Pros: I&apos;ve owned some good cans over the years. My dad had a old, heavy pair of Pioneer headphones from the 70&apos;s with leather pads. I thought those sounded good. They pale in comparison to these.

There are pieces I&apos;ve been listening to on cheap around-the-ear headphones for years that I&apos;ve heard all new nuances in. The passive environmental sound dampening is remarkable.

Cons: There is a bit of heft to them. If you&apos;re used to over- or in-ear headphones, or lightweight around-ear, it will take a while for you to get accustomed to these.

If you&apos;re using them with a portable media player, you may not get as much performance - they need some watts to drive them. They are also reference phones, which means they have flat (or nearly flat) response. A good EQ will improve you ... r experience. 

I have mine hooked up to a PC with a Creative Labs Audigy2 card, running Spacial Audio SAM Broadcaster, using its broadcast-quality sound processor. This really highlights the difference in headphones.

     <Review>During the day, I work in a cubical surrounded by other cubicals. With these headphones on, the only way I know my phone is ringing is because it has a red flashing light. Needless to say, these are GREAT at blocking out ambient noise. The sound reproduction is accurate and the sound stage is good - especially considering the price. The bass does not hit as hard as some of the semi-closed headphones, but it is responsive. These headphones are durable and comfortable. I can wear them for hours when I&apos;m editing video. All in all, if you are on a budget but want great sounding headphones, I would recommend these.</Review>

     <Review>Great headphones! Great sound and very comfortable. However, they don&apos;t block out very much outside sound like they claim to do. For the money, you can&apos;t get a better pair of headphones.
Great sound quality, completely covers ears, able to produce very loud and well rounded sound.
These are very nice headphones. They seem to be made of durable plastic and you can replace various pieces on it as they wear out.
I personally thought the headphones were expensive, but I have never purcahsed a nice pair before. The more research I did, I discovered that these particular headphones were basically the best value for the money.</Review>

     <Review>Pros: These headphones are sturdily built and sound great.

Cons: They were very uncomfortable. As other reviewers said they are very tight on your head and I have an average size head, not a gargantuan cranium. They also sit uncomfortably on the top of your head, possibly because of the weight, and limited padding. The ear pieces were a tiny bit smaller than the other Sennheiser&apos;s I&apos;ve tried, making my ears feel &apos;cramped&apos;. 
I couldn&apos;t wear them more than 30 minutes without a pretty good headache. 

My Old HD 265s were infinitely more comfortable - they have larger ear pieces, weigh less and don&apos;t &apos;clamp&apos; on your head nearly as tight. I have been able to ear those for hours and hours without any discomfort since I took them out of the box.

If you have a small head the ... se may be comfortable, otherwise I&apos;d look for another set of headphones.

     <Review>Pros: They are Durable. The sound quality is decent, comparable to other headphones in a lower price bracket.

Cons: EXTREMELY TIGHT. They get uncomfortable after 1hour+. Even with the adjustments, it&apos;s just painful for your head. 
Heavy bulky cord, if you need any extension it will drag the headphones. 
Sound quality is not worth the price.
I&apos;ve owned multiple &quot;Gaming&quot; headsets (fatal1ty, turtlebeach) with the exact same sound quality and they were much more comfortable to boot.

I got fooled by all the user ratings. Never gonna trust these anymore.
Discount deals always suck. Either settle for cheap or go all out for the good stuff.</Review>

     <Review>Pros: Great unit for the price. Sound quality is excellent, tight and crisp. Outstanding low frequency reproduction. Very clean, low noise, not muddy at all. Light and comfortable with adequate ambient noise attenuation.

Cons: You&apos;re not actually at the concert, it just sounds like you are.

Would recommend. Impressed with NewEgg.</Review>

     <Review>Pros: These are simply the best phones I&apos;ve ever owned. These things handle anything I throw at them and want to eat up more. 

I listen to all types of music - Techo, Trance, Hip Hop, Metal, Rock, Punk -as well as produce my own Trance- and I&apos;m telling you that these puppies handle them all and is still hungry for more. Very solid Deep Lows, and amazing highs - with everything in between. Anything 192kps &amp; higher MP3&apos;s will sound amazing....lower and you begin to really hear artifacts in poorly encoded mp3.

FLAC audio sounds freaking amazing! Nuff&apos; said.

They do require a small break-in to sound great. Mine took a couple hours. Now that they&apos;ve cleared their throat, they simply sound amazing. Buy these.

Cons: None.

Extreemly pleased with the whole pur ... chase. 
These might be the best phones on the market for their very reasonable price.

     <Review>Well, like me, you might be looking for accurate headphones that you can use during recording, mixing and even practicing. Well, then don&apos;t buy these Sennheisers. Don&apos;t get me wrong..they are OKAY headphones. But just okay. They are comfortable and seem fairly well made, but they are TOTALLY INACCURATE when it comes to sound reproduction. There&apos;s hardly any bass, there&apos;s too much midrange, and the high end is a bit screechy. Don&apos;t believe me? Then go down to your local guitar shop, try these through the headphone jack on any Yamaha digital piano (I love my S90ES). Then try a set of Beyerdynamic 770 pro 80&apos;s. Though the Beyers are twice the price, they are 4 times as accurate as these guys. And accuracy is EVERYTHING when you are recording/mixing.</Review>

     <Review>I use these headphones for PC use like listening to my music collection which contains all sorts of genres from classical, to rap and playing games. The response is very linear, which I like. Great for classical music where you want the most faithful reproduction. Low and high&apos;s are great, but ultimately, these are closed headphones which all suffer from mids being slightly reverberated. Comfort is also very good. After I broke the cushion in, I&apos;d wear these anywhere from 1 hour all the way to monster 6-hour sessions and I&apos;d never feel them on my head - even while wearing glasses. Between performance, comfort, and ease of use, these headphones are hard to beat at its price.</Review>

Cons: They are a bit big and bulky, but all great headphones are.</Review>

     <Review>Pros: Well, those are really nice headphones for that price. Bass is deep and thrilling though &quot;warm&quot;.The biggest advantage is the amazing and realistic surround effects. They will make you look around. And you can fold them in pretty tiny package, though cable is a little bit heavy.

Cons: The high range does not sound crystal clear by default. If you like to enjoy &quot;right&quot; sound of music you will have to play with equalizer a little bit. But even than there is no of that vibrating crystal clear sound in high range, that i have on my grados.

The best option in given price range. The perfect choice for music, movie and game lovers with limited finance.</Review>

     <Review>Pros: Very impressed, even after reading a large number of raving reviews about these headphones I was still a bit surprised. I found myself digging out my cd collection because the audio shortcomings in mp3&apos;s are much more noticeable all the sudden. The Bass is clear and precise and I&apos;ve checked with just about every genre of music I listen to ranging from classical to death metal and everything is beautiful, I even found myself leaning off the srs effects in media player on my computer in favor of the clear reproduction these headphones provide. This is a first I&apos;m upgrading into these after owning a pair of sony pro series for some time deciding it was time to replace them as they were aging. I can not stress enough how Glad I am I spent a few extra dollars to get these over my other ch ... oices.

Cons: If any I would say the reproduction may be a little too clear for some music formats lower bitrate mp3&apos;s sound pretty bad on these as all the shortcomings of the format become abundantly clear almost immediately. As some have said you will look a bit geeky wearing them on the go, but the sound quality far outweighs any possible embarrassment. 
64 ohm impedance will be a little rough on battery powered devices.

I can not stress enough how satisfied I am with this purchase. If your holding off on these because of the price, you will not be disappointed when they arrive. Replaceable pads and a 2 year warranty both support headphones that are built to both satisfy a consumer and last. Backed by a good company with a solid reputation I would recommend these to my own mother.

Great sound
Build quality

Cons: A bit bulky maybe? Doesn&apos;t bother my any.

These things are phenomenal. They are a bit tight, so I left one of my son&apos;s 6 inch bouncy balls between the speakers for a couple nights and fixed that problem. Instructions are included showing how to replace all the padding and the cable for future wear. Lastly, the sound is incredible. Nothing like any headphones I&apos;ve ever had.</Review>

     <Review>Pros: Excellent noise isolation, incredible sound reproduction, great value. You will notice details in your music that you have never heard before.

Cons: I wasted too much money on pair after pair of cheap headphones. I finally realized that if you buy a quality pair of headphones they will sound incredible and not break every few months.

A little advice: 
1. Burn these in for a couple days, the improvement in sound quality is dramatic

2. If you feel the bass is lacking (a common complaint) adjust your EQ settings. These are capable of some downright incredible bass if that is what you are looking for</Review>

     <Review>These headphones were everything I hoped they would be when I read the reviews. Very easy to use, comfortable when on for extended periods of time (wore it for about 2 hours and only felt slight uncomfortable feeling), and the sound covers highs and lows quite nicely. I would definitely recommend these to anyone who is interested in a high quality set of headphones but for an average to low price.</Review>

     <Review>Pros: Awesome response. Tight bass. Overall great sound.
I&apos;m very happy with these coupled with a high quality sound card. I&apos;ve used these in live environments for PFL on a mixer. I hear stuff through these headphones that just disappear when listening on other cheaper sets.

Cons: You&apos;ll look like a dork wearing them.
The headband has started to come off and I can&apos;t find a replacement (after about 4 years). 
I&apos;m pretty sure these have been discontinued.</Review>

     <Review>Pros: Great sound, excludes noise, folds small. I&apos;ve owned these for 28 months and taken them on numerous long flights; as long as 10+ hours. They are great to exclude the engine noise and especially important if you are surrounded by crying babies.

Cons: The main complaint is that the foam cushions have fallen apart. Inside seam separated. I don&apos;t abuse them, this is a design flaw. It did take this long (just out of warranty) for them to get bad enough to replace. I easily ordered a replacement set from the Sennheiser website store for $25 including shipping. I like the headphones but at $100 the cushions should last more than two years of occasional use. Also - The cord is nice and long but sometimes a little cumbersome to stow in my camera bag.

I took one side off to consi ... der stitching then back together, didn&apos;t seem like it would be easy. It was difficult to put the cushion back on. I did get it though.
Also - on trips I bought a square plastic box to store/protect them on trips while not flying. Rick Steves soft bag offers no protection.

     <Review>For the same money, you can get a pair of Sony MD-7506?s which are much more accurate headphones. The Sennheisers are built like a tank, if a bit heavy. They definitely seal outside sounds out. The problem I have with them is the lack of clarity and accuracy in the important midrange area. They have lots of sizzle (too much?) and their bottom end is very deep. (Heavy bass can make them distort, however...) I own both these and the Sony&apos;s and reach for the Sony&apos;s when I need to listen for accuracy. The Sennheisers are great for general purpose listening.</Review>

     <Review>Overall, i will give them a perfect in terms of how they sound, how the feel and for my application usage, i won&apos;t be negative about the burn in process as it did not effect me very much, though admitingly it was scary to get a $100 pair of headphones that sounded like something made in a basement, Read Quality about burning in the head phones ot increase thier performance. 
I love how the cans swivle, it helps with pressure against your head, everybody has a different shape which makes us unique and these compensate for that uniquness. The high&apos;s and Mid&apos;s are amazing, but read the &quot;Quality&quot; part of my review on more about this. It comes with a 1/4&apos; screw on adapter which is hand, plug it into your MP3 player or PC and use the adapter for your intruments.
I urge anyone purchasing he ... adphones, whether these or another, to read this

The Quality, when i first pulled these out of the box i felt like i wasted $100, they didn&apos;t sound much better than a $15 pair of wal mart ear buds, even the bass was bad, it was distorting the entire reverb on any note, playing classical music, no problem, playing a R&amp;B song, sounded like someone blowing in your ear at best, i had a 192khz/24bit raw sample available of many different sounds and it was bad, i mean real bad.

Here is the thing, little did i know you have to &quot;burn-in&quot; headphones, yeah, news to me, well i followed a guide which you can google &quot;Burn in headphones guide&quot; or something of that nature and come up with some information. I do NOT suggest using white noise, pink noise or any of that garbage, set a playlist of several different types of music, some with guitar, some with bass, some with female singers, male singers, get a good 100 hours of music and put it on repeat for about 5 or 6 hours, put the volume at normal listening volume (it doesn&apos;t need to be any louder than that!) and just leave it, come back and let your headphones &quot;rest&quot; for about 30 minutes, if you want, you can continue stressing, this time for 10 hours, do an increase in time after each pause but start alittle lower (3-5 hours) work up to 10 until you have stressed it for a total of about 80-100 hours including normal usage.

I did this for 8 hours today after my initial dissapointment and i honestly had zero hope it would make any difference, but holy cow it did!, the bass on these picked up to a nice smooth woof like it&apos;s supposed to be, it isn&apos;t a hard hit but it&apos;s enough to know its there and feel it in your head without distorting the rest of the sounds like it was doing. I was more interested in the highs and Mids because i am a pianist, but i&apos;m considering these for netflix and other multimedia purposes now. I don&apos;t think they are quite where they should be and from my limited knowledge they will get a massive leap in quality around 50 hours, at this 50 hour point if they continue to gain in performance like thye did before i&apos;m going to think they are more valuable than i paid for them.

I can&apos;t stress enough how much of a difference it made, there is no need to turn them up very loud, i had them at about speech volume in my ears which isn&apos;t very loud, just normal usage volume. Turning them up to much isn&apos;t going to help or make the burn in go any faster, it juust risks ruining your headphones.
At first i thought i got ripped off, see Quality above. you really need to burn these headphones in to hear what they can really do.

     <Review>Pros: These headphone have amazing isolation, I can&apos;t hear my fans, the heater or the keyboard I typing now. I can listen to song at ridiculous low volume and have them still sound amazing. It has great detail, especially listening to classical music, yet have enough base for hip-hop

Cons: The coiled single cord is really bothering me. I have them connect to my computer setting on the floor. Because the wires are coiled, most them on in air, so I have carry the entire length of wire with my head. Since the wire is only on one side, so it isn&apos;t balanced. After a few hour, i can feel a strain in my neck. Also the clamping force is a bit to get used to, but that&apos;s the price you pay for good isolation.

great deal for $100, especially with the free PXC-150 combo deal. But also con ... sider headphones with an open design if you don&apos;t need the isolation, those produce a truer sound

     <Review>Pros: I generally don&apos;t write reviews, but this product is truly exceptional and a very good price. I have been searching for a superior set of earphones for years to use for live recording and general listening - a lot of experimenting and wasted money. These phones really do the job. They have a transparency and definition that makes listening a real joy and provide the level of detail required for quality recording. 
They came bundled with a pair of PXC-150 noise-cancelling phones for free. These are fun to play with.

Cons: There is a claim of 32db of isolation, and this is rather wishful thinking. I wear sound isolators on the job, and know what 28db (very high level) of isolation sounds like. These phones do, however, have better isolation than any other phones I have tried ... with the exception of experimental phones I have constructed for my own use and in-the-ear units - they are quite adequate for most recording, and the exceptional sound quality makes up for a lot.
The other overly-optimistic claim is that they collapse down to a compact size. Frankly, they are just big, and they do get a bit smaller. Not really for the subway.

     <Review>If you are looking for headphones for studio use, these may be for you. If not, I would pass. The sound is adequate, but not great. I listen mainly to classical music and the string sound produced by these is kind of thin (like the old transistor radio sound) and lacks body. Also, they sound a little weak in bass and detail in the low frequencies is not very impressive. Even more of a problem is the sheer bulk of these big goofy looking headphones. If you are thinking of using these at work, know that they will look awfully big on your head. The black coiled chord is the old Bell Telephone sort, so heavy that it can pull an ipod off a table, or cause the headphones to tilt to one side if you wear them while walking around. The sound is not good enough to justify the antiquated physical des ... ign, which needs to be updated.

     <Review>Pros: They are very comfortable, fully surround your ears, yet still manage to seem light and remarkably unannoying. Despite not being too heavy on the head, they very effectively mute-out almost all ambient sounds, so all you&apos;ll hear is the great sound coming from the speakers. I specifically bought them wanting this feature. That ear-isolation helps to create a great sound and exceptional bass.

Cons: I own two sets of these. I love them both. I&apos;ve owned them for more than 5 years and they still sound awesome. Before I bought them, I read a person&apos;s review who claimed part of the plastic would eventually fall apart. Another reviewer accused him of just mistreating them. I can tell you. There is a part of the band that goes over your head: it will eventually begin to flake into shar ... ds and disintegrate (both sides, on both my sets). However, the speakers, all the wires, and even all the hinge points (thank goodness) are not susceptible to this problem. Only the plastic encasing arch on either side of the main head pad, and extending almost to the first pivots, is affected. (there is a strong/light metal skeleton inside the main arch) Long story short: it takes a long time to develop and it will never will truly &quot;ruin&quot; them.

On a side-note, the complex folding variations of these headphones turns out to be very handy, in my opinion. It&apos;s almost impossible to stress these, because the seem to want to fold or pivot quite naturally in every direction. The most important pieces of plastic (structural pieces, pivots and joints) do not break, and seem to want to last forever.
I use these constantly, very happy. Absolute 5 out of 5 if not for the odd but persistent plastic headband breakdown. So I gotta give 4. Love &apos;em like 5.

     <Review>Pros: These headphones have very crisp and clear sound, and plenty of bass but not an excessive amount. The first time I listened to my music collections with these I was blown away. I could hear all sorts of little nuances that I had never noticed before. The noise cancelling is very nice also, it allows you to listen to the music at a quieter volume (which is less fatiguing) but still hear all the details. They seem quite durable as well. I&apos;ve had 2 pairs of them, the first pair only needed to be replaced due to me abusing them by stepping on them. I&apos;ve had the 2nd pair about 3 years and they still sound/look pretty much brand new.

Cons: If you have any lower quality mp3s it will be very noticeable. Anything below 256kbps mp3 will have bad artifacts, and I need 320kbps mp3 ... or wav/flac now. This isn&apos;t really a con so much, just something to be aware of :)

They do take some time to &quot;break in&quot; but this is true of all hi-quality speakers/headphones. They sound good from the start, but they sound even better after several hours of using them.

     <Review>I purchased these recently after doing a lot of debating, review reading, and comparing. For the price and the quailty you really can&apos;t beat these. The reviews were very accurate, there&apos;s a good presence of bass and low-end you can hear. They&apos;re very comfortable and you really can&apos;t beat the price. Although they were $5 cheaper at Guitar Center, that&apos;s alright cause these came straight to my door.

The only thing I&apos;d suggest is picking up an extension cable from wal-mart because the cable on these is coiled and really won&apos;t extend too far beyond a laptop being right in front of you.
I mean just look at the price. I urge you to attempt to find a better quality at this price. You won&apos;t be able to.</Review>

     <Review>Pros: Comfortable for long time wearing, crystal clear sound on all ranges! I being using these as my study pair (Eng. student) for almost 2 years and they still have not come apart or loosen any quality, in fact they get better over time. Can be very loud if and still accurate if pushed, in fact some times I just leave them on my desk as small speakers. Great sound isolation too.

Cons: Somewhat big, a bit heavy and tight, but I still use for hours on end.

I don&apos;t think many in understand that these headphones need some breaking in, that is you need to play music on them for a while before they loosen up. The Base was flat the first week I had it, but it certainly loosen up after playing on them a while. They get better as time goes on, don&apos;t judge these until you use them fo ... r a good while. I also use these for gaming which makes them the only headphones I have being able to use for both very high quality sound and laud game sounds.

     <Review>Pros: Comfortable earcups. Clear treble and accurate bass. Very sturdy, heavy plastic construction. Collapsable and foldable. Not the best sounding headphones in the world, but definitely worth the price you pay.

Cons: Does not come with a carrying pouch...

Bass is accurate but not powerful. This means songs with very deep bass like Nine Inch Nails sound amazing, but conventional music may sound hollow depending on what you are used to.

The headband is very uncomfortably tight on the head when it is brand new, but they stretch out after a week or two and become more comfortable.</Review>

Cons: N/A

Having these &apos;phones has only made me want to invest in a discreet sound card and load my system up with lossless tracks. With these you&apos;ll begin to notice nuances in songs you&apos;ve listened to countless times...they bring definition to an otherwise flat listening experience.</Review>

     <Review>Pros: Sound is accurate

Cons: Build of Headband

I purchased these after much research and can say that Sennheiser hasn&apos;t let me down. I put them on and the sound was crisp and impressed me from the beginning. However...my one complaint is the way they fit. They&apos;re comfortable and all, but when I glanced into the mirror I realized how ridiculous I looked b/c of how far they bowed out from my head. I plan on wearing these in public on occasion and honestly wouldn&apos;t feel comfortable doing so with this particular pair. This shouldn&apos;t discourage ppl from purchasing them unless they&apos;re avid public users, I just personally feel a little silly. I think I will exchange for something a little more snug.</Review>

     <Review>Pros: Value

Cons: Nothing.

General Observations:
- I&apos;ve read reviews where people say the cord is too short. I disagree.
- The earmuffs do a good job of isolating sound without being noise-cancelling.
- People have complained that the bass is substandard. Again, I disagree. Bass capabilities are not bad.
- As for comfort, everybody&apos;s head is different. Mine is kind of large but I can wear these for a few hours without wanting to take them off.

I mostly got them for listening to mp3&apos;s and occasionally playing video games, for which, they work great. For my applications, I wasn&apos;t ready to break that $300 mark. If you&apos;re looking for a decent set of headphones that won&apos;t break the bank, then I think you&apos;ll be satisfied.</Review>

     <Review>Pros: Cheap when I got them on sale here. Couldn&apos;t resist buying it at that price. Very clean sound.

Cons: TOO TIGHT! It&apos;s like having my head in a vice. I wear headphones almost 24/7, but even after just about 30 minutes of wearing these, I ended up getting a migraine. It&apos;s a bummer really. I was so looking forward to them, and now I can&apos;t even stand to wear them. Iunderstand they need to be pressed up on the ears to work as intended, but it certainly doesn&apos;t need to be this tight. Even after I modded them to be looser, I still couldn&apos;t stand it. I went back to my Sony MDR XB500&apos;s, which don&apos;t sound as good (obviously) but the comfort of them is off the charts. The Sony 500&apos;s are like little Pillows on my head. It&apos;s Sublime comfort.

If you don&apos;t mind tight headphones then ma ... ybe these are for you, but people like me who wear headphones 24/7; I can&apos;t see these being an option. They&apos;re simply too tight. I wish I didn&apos;t buy them.

     <Review>Pros: The sound is phenomenal, great performance and extremely high tops, though the soundstage doesn&apos;t feel as open as it should on the ends of the frequency range. Bass can go down very deep, but these headphones neutralize any boosting and create sound that is nearly exactly what the masterers intended.

Cons: Though sturdy, it is a little clunky to get around. It feels big around your head, and some people say that it doesn&apos;t stretch far enough (if you have a big head, these might not be for you).
Not very loud on iPhones/mp3 players due to the high (64 Ohm) resistance.

If you listen to music and you&apos;d like a lot of bass, the Sony MDR-7506 is a good replacement.</Review>

     <Review>Overall, I would definately recommend these phones for an in-home studio use. I haven&apos;t had a lot of headphones to compare them to, but they will definitely serve the purpose I need.
I love these headphones for the purpose I bought them. I am using them in an in-home studio environment and they are awesome. The block most noise and the clarity is great. 
I find nothing wrong with the quality of these phones except the scrunchy cord. I personally don&apos;t like the elasticity of the cord because I feel like it pulls at me constantly if I move away from a device. 
These phones are a great value. These aren&apos;t some $9.99 CD headphones. These are a real pro&apos;s choice.</Review>

     <Review>Pros: Comfortable; Good Value; Durable; Great Sound

Cons: Unattractive Design; Too Much Ambient Noise

Good sound quality. Don&apos;t claim to be noise canceling, but do a reasonable job. Can&apos;t compete with Bose in that category, but at 1/3 the price, I wouldn&apos;t expect them to.</Review>

     <Review>I am very happy with the subject headphones on all accounts. Try them and I feel you will agree!!
The headphones encompass your entire ear, provide excellent sound quality, are attractive, and appear to be well made. As an added benefit the essential parts are replaceable if damaged, which is a unique quality.
 Excellent quality, very comfortable, sound is beatiful, it address my needs at a reasonable price.
The build quality, sound quality, and comfort for the price is what determines value for me and these headphone are a 10 on all counts!!</Review>

     <Review>Pros: Sturdy. I like the thick cord.

Cons: I bought these to replace my HD265&apos;s because the cord on them is wimpy and I&apos;ve had to replace the cord twice.
The highs and mids are ok on the HD280&apos;s but the bass is weak when I compare to my HD265. The HD 265&apos;s have a warm, full, strong bass and the HD280 seem to be trying so hard to be almost that. These truly sound like any other $39 dollar headset.

They just do not make stuff like they used to!
I&apos;ll give the HD280 headset to someone as a X-mas gift and buy yet another cord my HD265&apos;s.</Review>

     <Review>Pros: I&apos;ve owned these phones for 2 years and have yet to encounter 1 issue with them. They sound incredible and the overall durability is excellent. I&apos;ve owned AKG, Sony, and many others and they all fall far short on sound quality and overall construction. My phones still look new and perform great with no pad wear. The price is insanely low for what you get and sound quality exceeds many phones costing 4x as much. You cannot go wrong with these.

Cons: None. Some complain about the coiled cable.. You either love or hate it but it&apos;s super long and perfect for a studio etc.

If you&apos;re skeptical, listen yourself at any music store that sells these. You&apos;ll find out for yourself that these phones sound the best for the price point. Compare with a $400.00 pair and you&apos;ll he ... ar how great these sound. Very detailed sound with awesome bass response. A very balanced detailed sound in all aspects. BTW, you can get a microphone attachment for these. A very cool feature.

     <Review>Pros: These headphones are great! The treble is nice and balanced with the bass. And the bass is only there if it needs to be. Very clear sound and comfortable. Plus, it looks like individual components on the headphones can be replaced if needed.

Cons: None right now.

Well worth the money spent.</Review>

     <Review>Pros: Reproduction is very good, but db attenuation is great. I find myself wearing them not plugged in on plane flights to quell the jet noise, and I&apos;m much more relaxed at flight&apos;s end. Even without noise cancellation it&apos;s nearly as good as those that have it. If you do want to listen on the plane, the volume doesn&apos;t have to override so much background noise.

Cons: Infrequent price reductions!</Review>

     <Review>Pros: Good overall linear response with good base, treble, and mid-range. Decent isolation of outside noise. Durable design for home/work use.

Cons: Too bulky for portable use. HF5 fits the &quot;student&quot; bill for portability. Bass dips a tiny bit at very low frequency. Don&apos;t block low frequency outside noise at all.

Really good for a student/gamer set of headphones as they will cut out the fan noise from case fans while under use. You hate the tinnyness or boominess of cheaper headphones? You can&apos;t go wrong with these!</Review>

     <Review>Pros: The quality of these headphones are absolutely great. The sound quality is also stunning. I must say that these were worth the money. They are comfortable too. I play many FPS games, and these are a beautiful addition to my gameplay experience.

Cons: To be honest it seems as if dampens the bass just a bit. That and it drains battery life of my Zune faster. Even though they are comfortable, they can slide off if you put your head back, not too much a problem though.
They also seem pretty bulky (even despite the fact that they are headphones)

Even though there are some cons, I believe that the pros are better, thus 5 eggs. Also, they may not look very cool when you&apos;re wearing them, but when they are put around your neck you feel like a total bad*ss.</Review>

     <Review>I use these for home recording. I don&apos;t have a headphone amp, so I run them through an old Technics receiver. I use the Loudness control on the receiver to compensate for the flat response. They sound great and are very well made. They do a great job of isolation. I find they are a little tight on my head.</Review>
