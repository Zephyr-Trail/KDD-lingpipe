     <Review>Pros: Sound, comfort, amazing bass, price

Cons: Honestly, nothing. These are perfect.

I am a musician and a producer, so for me, sound quality is everything. In the studio I need headphones with a perfectly balanced sound, and clear reproduction of the sound image. These headphones might not be the best studio option due to the excessive bass. However, I was impressed with their performance in the high and mid range, considering the name-sake &quot;Extra Bass.&quot; I was lucky enough to be able to compare these back to back with the Beats Pro, and my conclusion surprised me.

Beats Pro By Dr. Dre
When I first put these on there was one thing that struck me. And that was the surprising LACK of comfort for a pair of cans with such a large ear cushion. That isn&apos;t to say that the ... y are uncomfortable, but they don&apos;t live up to their appearance. Now on to the sound
The highs were clear, and well defined, if not a bit piercing at times. That was one of the key differences between the two products: On the beats the highs felt separated, as though they are coming from a different source then the rest of the music. This is not a huge problem, and the difference isn&apos;t terrible noticeable, but it does give them a colder sound. The warmth of the bass and mids somewhat made up for it, but they didn&apos;t have the same warm feel that the Sony&apos;s have. The Bass was strong, and felt well rounded. They did a good job of blocking out external sound. All in all the sound was very good, relatively clear, but not as warm as I would have liked.

Sony MDR XB500
These headphones are without a doubt the most comfortable pair of headphones I have ever worn. They feel amazing. I put them on, and immediately wanted to test the extra bass, so I played several of the most bass-heavy tracks on my iPod. They sound absolutely amazing. The sound is warm and clear, with the emphasis obviously on the bass, but that is not for lack of highs or mids. In fact, I was very impressed with the refinement of the sound in all aspects. The highs were a little dull, but not to a point where they are drowned out, ...

     <Review>Pros: The SOUND!!!!

Cons: These aren&apos;t for jogging.

I bought these for my wife, but I wish they were mine.
-The bass performance is fantastic, better than other powered headphones I&apos;ve tried which I think distort the sound and balance of the music. Plus there are no batteries to replace and no batteries to make the headphones heavier.
-The cushions that fit over ears are quite big and comfortable. They block out ambient sound much better than most noise-cancelling phones I&apos;ve tried. For better or worse, with these on you won&apos;t hear much what&apos;s going on around you. I have to remove them when anyone talks to me. Again, you get this without batteries.
-The headphones are lighter than they appear. They are a big large and bulky looking, but when I took them out of the pa ... ckage, the lightness was surprising.
-The cushioning that sits on your head looks thin compared with other over-the-ear headphones. I was afraid that without bigger cushions to sit on my head that they would not be comfortable over time. It is not an issue at all. Perhaps cause they are really light or I have a hard head. You decide.
-The cable is flat, thin and about 1/4 inch wide--not round like most headphones. I am not sure what advantage or disadvantage this is but I think it looks cool and might be less susceptible to the common wire issues of most earbuds with the too skinny wiring that breaks over time. There is a cable on each side of the head. There is a small R and L for correct orientation.
-The headphones fit my wife well who has a smaller head. They also fit me well, even though I have a larger head. No comment, please. They can accomodate heads much larger than mine (yours?).
-They seem sturdy, but I have not owned them long enough to decide. Or my wife hasn&apos;t. I keep forgetting they are hers.
-The cable length seems OK. Not too long but not too short either.
-My recommendation. Get them. I tried them out before I bought them. They sound better than the Bose and others I tried which cost a lot more.

     <Review>A friend and I have been searching for great headphones that had a great sound for under $100. Between him and I, we purchased 6 sets of headphones and even though they were good, we still wasn&apos;t satisfied. I came across these Sony MDR-XB500 headphones and they might be the ones we have been looking. I have listened to music with these everyday and they perform every time. The sound quality is superb for the price. A lot of reviews I read said the highs can get drowned out by the bass but I don&apos;t think so. It&apos;s still really clear with a low bass. However, I would like it if the bass had a harder hit but that&apos;s still very small thing. Maybe purchasing the XB700 (50mm) or XB1000 (70mm) would produce a harder bass hit. The comfort level on these are amazing. It&apos;s like having two pillows aro ... und your ear. I wear glasses and it&apos;s still comfortable with them for extended wear. The cord is the flat style so it doesn&apos;t tangle up easily or at all. The length of the cord is a little shorter than normal but for what I use it for, it&apos;s perfectly ok. I&apos;m usually listening to music/videos on the computer or my mp3 player that&apos;s in my pocket. Also, I love the 90 degree bend on the headphone jack. The design and look of the headphones is just awesome. It looks very nice and feels very durable. It&apos;s not too heavy, but not too light either to feel flimsy. Sony did a really good job with these and for the price, it&apos;s even better.

     <Review>Pros: Worth every penny.

Cons: Slightly fragile (I think).

I love these headphones. I had tried them in the store while just browsing, not really looking to buy anything, but once I put them on, and played Me &amp; You by Nero on full blast, I knew I had to get them. It didn&apos;t hurt that they were on sale either.

The first thing you notice when you put them on is how comfortable they are. They&apos;re so squishy! Also, they fit all the way around your ears. Then when you begin listening to them, you notice the insane clarity. They are designed to handle 4-24,000 Hz, so you hear every frequency. The bass (which is what I bought them for) is amazing! I can feel my head vibrate! It&apos;s like having computer speakers right on your ears. As a matter of fact, I just put them on the t ... able sometimes to use as speakers. They are sort of noise-canceling as well, which is a plus. In the mornings before school, my friends try to talk to me, but I can&apos;t hear a single thing they&apos;re saying. The only thing that I don&apos;t like is that they feel slightly fragile. I&apos;m very careful with them, and I bought a replacement plan for $15. Anyway, for the price, these are incredibly worth it. I would easily spend over $100 for headphones of this quality.

     <Review>Pros: Durable; Comfortable; Good Value; Great Sound; Good Bass; Lightweight; Stylish; Compact

Spectacular deep bass, immersive sound quality, beautiful design, and great comfort. The Sony Extra Bass headphones achieve all of these attributes easily. These XB headphones present an acoustic epiphany between your ears. The Sony MDR-XB500 Extra Bass headphones deliver pulsating bass performance with superb vocal clarity for music, movies, and games. In reality, this Sony product represents the finest technological achievement in the stereo headphones product category. The Sony MDR-XB500 audiophile headphones offer ultimate comfort with its highly adjustable plush headband, and pillow quality king-sized ear cushions that cover the most advanced 40mm dynamic headphone drivers on the plan ... et. I am unable to hear other outside distractions in my immediate environment when wearing the Sony stereo headphones. The Sony MDR-XB500 headphones are so comfortable that it is just disappointing to remove them after an exhilarating and lengthy private listening session. The concert venue sonic experience offered by the Sony headphones makes me feel as if a live band is performing right in front of me. No matter what musical preference that you have, the sound reproduction emanating from this beautifully designed pair of headphones is so wonderful, that there is no comparison in audio quality with other headphone brands on the market. The Sony MDR-XB500 Extra Bass headphones demonstrate extraordinary and prodigious bass output that is instantly addictive. In my judgment, the audio sounds better through this pair of Sony XB headphones, than a component stereo system playing through Hi-Fi tower loudspeakers. The Sony Extra Bass headphones sport an attractive appearance with its large over-the-ear design, sturdy construction, cloth-covered headband, silver ear cup exterior finish, and a 3.9 ft. flat Y-type cord. Of course, the Sony MDR-XB500 headphones feature a sealed acoustic design for improved sound isolation characteristics, direct vibe structure for the highest quality sound output, 3.5mm gold-plated L-shaped stereo mini plug for maximum signal transfer and compatibility with the widest range of portable audio, video, MP3, computer, and home audio equipment possible. The Sony Extra Bass headphones provide the following feature set for the dedicated deep bass fanatic : two channel stereo reproduction, 40mm diameter XB drivers, neodymium high-energy magnets, dome type speaker drivers, L/R ear cup placement markings, extended low frequency response diaphragm design, gaskets, pressure-relieving ear cushions, 1.8&quot; ear cup thickness, 3.7&quot; ear cup diameter, Copper-Clad Aluminum Wire Voice Coil, lightweight tangle-free flat cord, adjustable headband for maximum comfort, over-the-head circum-aural closed design, 1500mW power handling capacity, 4-24,000 Hz frequency response, 40 ohms at 1kHz impedance rating, 104db/mW sensitivity rating, black/silver exterior finish, and this unit&apos;s weight is 6.53 ounces without cord. The Sony headphones come packaged with a carrying pouch for storage or safe transport to another destination. I primarily use the Sony MDR-XB500 Extra Bass headphones with my Sony CFD-G700CP XPLOD boombox to achieve out-of-this-world exact sound performance. The Sony headphones include a 90-day parts and labor limited manufacturer warranty. The Sony headphones are suitable for use at home, at work, on the boardwalk, on the ferry, at the gym, the hotel room, business travel, at the library, the local coffee shop, and the bookstore. It&apos;s also an excellent choice for year round use to listen to classical music, classic rock music, hard rock, punk rock, disco, blues, jazz, opera, and country music. Please note that you will need a 1/8&quot; to ¼&quot; stereo headphone plug adapter to connect the Sony MDR-XB500 headphones to a home stereo system. I use a headphone extension cord with the Sony Extra Bass headphones when I listen to a component based stereo system. With its world class bass performance, exceptional midrange, and stunning...

     <Review>I have been used MDR-XB500 for about a month. It is very light headphones and has good design. It is easy to adjust the size so it would perfectly fit to your head. However, since it is not fordable, I do not recommend this to people who travel a lot with headphones. It has two large ear cups. They are good to cancel noise from the outside, and they produce really good extra bass sound. I use my headphone to listen music (classic, pop, hip-hop, any kind of music) from my ipod, and laptop. The extra bass sound is really awesome; especially, when I listen to hip-hop music. In addition, it is also good to watch action movies. Any sound of gunshot or punch sound makes me excited with this headphone.</Review>

     <Review>Pros: Good Price/Quality ratio, Bass, Comfort

Cons: Treble, Upper Mids

Pros: Deep well extended bass, rather clear sound, comfort
Cons: Rolled off highs and upper mids.

Unfortunately I do not have the packaging or accessories for the XB. I am borrowing these from a friend and the box has been since thrown away.

Design and Build Quality

The first thing you&apos;ll notice is how huge the pleather pads are. They look rather silly to be honest, but actually provide a nice seal around the ears and help provide decent isolation. The pads are also very comfortable, though they get warm during extended listening. The headphones themselves are made of plastic, there&apos;s nothing special here but they feel solid enough. On either side of the headband where it adjusts So ... ny is written. Below that on the cups the model number and side indicator is given.

Each cup has a flat sturdy feeling cable coming from it that meets at the Y-split. The cables feel flexible and well made. The Y-split is simply a blank plastic almost rectangle that combines the two sides. The cable terminates into a gold plated 3.5mm L shaped plug which feels well made.

The XB500 won&apos;t bat any eyes with it&apos;s plastic build but it feels well made regardless. The comfort provided by the enormous pleather pads is fantastic and the XB500 sit light on the head while feeling secure. For the $50 these can be had for I haven&apos;t found another full-sized headphone that has the comfort the XB500 have. Above average build quality here.

Sound Quality

These have had at least 50 hours of use from my friend so I jumped right in to listening.

The model is called the XB500, which stands for Xtra Bass. The XB500 do not fail on that department. These are certainly basshead headphones and are capable of pumping out some serious bass that&apos;s not only well extended, but surprisingly well controlled with good speed for the quantity. The bass is certainly the focus here and it gives the headphones a warm sound. On bass heavy tracks I find my ears vibrating, though the bass isn&apos;t as overwhelming as I would e ...

     <Review>Pros: Sound, comfort, style, outstanding price

Cons: nothing

I had been looking for a good pair of headphones for about a week, and I came up with a list of a few: beats solo hd, these sonys, and audio technica monitors. I watched and read countless reviews of all of them. First of all, let me start by saying that beats are overpriced. The sound quality is excellent, and they are the best looking headphones out there, but they snap way to easily. Every single studio and solo hd were broken at 2 best buys. Anyways, I didnt think that the audio technicas were very stylish, which plays a small role in picking headphones. Finally, it came down to the sonys and phillips oneils, which are another good pair of headphones. I chose these. These are the best ~100$ headphones out there ... by far. Comfort is...well you can tell by the pic, unmatched. About an inch of cushioning for your ears! The sound quality is awesome too! The bass is crisp and doesnt block out anything. These are also a lot lighter than they look. Very durable, thich plastic. They look alot better in person too. They also dont need batteries, which is great .Only cons would be that they leak a little buut really not much. Overall, if your looking for great headphones for ANY price, these are awesome

     <Review>Pros: Awesome bass, great quality, all out amazing headphones.

Cons: The size. But nothing else.

These headphones are amazing. I strongly recommend them. These don&apos;t get the name of extra bass for no reason. These headphones play all the bass notes. Lows, mids, and highs. The quality is amazing. Also great for watching movies. Just all out great headphones. I use them at home on Skype calls, at home when listening to music, and on the go when listening to music. The only thing that I would complain about is the size of these. They are humongous. They are huge for a reason because they pack a lot of bass. These are affordable. Only $80 and are the BEST. I strongly recommend them.
Thanks for reading</Review>

These may be my favorite headphones of all time. I had some $80 apple headphones that don&apos;t even compare to this. The XB500 have a great price and are worth every penny spent. These are even better than Dr. Dre headphones by far. Great buy!!</Review>

     <Review>The bass in these headphones surpasses anything to be expected for a headphone of it&apos;s pricerange. The boomy feel provides that hardcore vibe that EDM/Techno/Rap listeners love. When EQ&apos;d properly, these headphones provide an incredibly solid, powerful bassline, that doesn&apos;t muddy up the highs or mids. The highs are powerful, and quite unique, actually, though without an EQ or amp, they can sound quite bright, or harsh at times. The mids unfortunately are not as defined, and unless you EQ them, they will not deliver as expected. These headphones are incredible for you dubstep heads out there, though for you metal fans, it may be better to stick with another line. However, even if you own a high-end pair of headphones , these headphones are a great, fun piece to add to your hi-fi collection ... , and they&apos;ll have you appreciating deep, powerful bass. These headphones truly live up to their advertising, and I&apos;ve thoroughly enjoyed the experience.

     <Review>These headphones are disappointing because despite the wide frequency range claimed on the box, when you listen they lack detail and sound muddled with all but the simplest pieces of music. The closed back design causes the treble to sound compressed; the bass extension is good but can be too much if you turn the volume up high. I had to turn down the bass on my amp which is a first!
I did have a positive experience with my old ipod video 5g which until now has never managed to produce any bass whatsoever. With the ipods EQ turned off these headphones actually sound quite good, but then i&apos;m not going jogging wearing these.
Construction is reasonable, and they are very lightweight and comfortable but the cable is far too short unless you&apos;re using a portable player.
On balance, OK i ... f all you want is bass but not recommended if you&apos;re into your hifi.

     <Review>My listening preferences tend to be very bass-heavy. Theses headphone do not disappoint - they are able to reach all the lows very nicely. Because I do most of my listening while working by the computer, I wear headphones for extended periods of time. The puffy cushions aren&apos;t just pretty - they are comfortable. All day long. Some of the highs get muddied, but some tweaking of the EQ, and it&apos;s more than acceptable. The headphones deliver as promised - with extra bass. The only real downside I&apos;ve encountered is the cord: much too short, even when I&apos;m at my desk. I would&apos;ve preferred a single cord instead of a Y-type, but it hasn&apos;t been a nuisance yet. For the price, if you love listening to deep bass (my go-to is trance), you shan&apos;t be disappointed. I promise.</Review>

     <Review>Pros: Excellent quality, deep rich bass, comfort

Cons: Cable a little short

I hate shopping for headphones. When you&apos;re shopping for headphones, you can read reviews all you want, but everyone is going to have a different opinion on sound quality, comfort, and design. If the majority of the reviews are good, then you know you will more than likely be happy with that certain headphone, but more than once I&apos;ve been burned by this method. With this headphone, I&apos;ve finally found what I&apos;m looking for though.

For the price, these headphone I&apos;ll say are the best around, hands down. The audio quality is the best I&apos;ve ever heard, with the 40mm drive units actually screwed to the structure vs. being glued on like some of the other cheaper headphones. The bass is actually bass, n ... ot just a vibration in the headphone like others. I&apos;ll sometimes have to turn down the volume because the bass pressure can cause me to get a little nauseous. The comfort is top notch. The king size ear cushion may look goofy, but the quality of the leather and the comfort of the cushion are the best I&apos;ve seen yet. I have piercings in my ears, and having these headphones on doesn&apos;t irritate my ears like other over-ear headphones have. My ears do sweat a little, but not enough to make it uncomfortable. The flat cord is nice as well, keeps it from getting tangled.

All and all I&apos;m extremely happy with this purchase and would recommend anyone who wants good quality, audio rich headphones at a reasonable price.

     <Review>Pros: comfort, sound, design, price

Cons: none

Most headphones either lack bass, or clarity. Not these xb500s, first point tho is the ear pads, and the headband. These are the single most comfortable to wear I have ever had, or tried. Even my 450 dollar AKG K-701s are not this comfortable. The earpads are over stuffed, I mean they are puffed up. The leather feels real good, very high quality, the stitching looks like it is hand sewn, very very nice, like a top high-end leather sofa. The headband is made with soft leather and is padded too, not as stuffed, but soft padded.
The cord is medium length and is stylishly flat, seems sturdy.
The drivers are screwed into the chassis, not cheaply glued in, 8 screws each driver. I was shocked. Those drivers sound supreme too. Deep ... bass, I mean deeeep. Punchy, and booming when needed. I ran subwoofer test and calibration tracks and these things just nearly took it all. Loud and deep, or pounding bass you can feel them. Stunning(dangerous too if not careful, I was getting dizzy and sick), unlike I had feared the bass does not drown out the vocals, mids or highs, and the soundstage is very accurate.
These headphones do what the skullcrushers fail to do, deliver impressive bass, and accurate high definition sound.
I highly recommend these over the dre beats(I wasn&apos;t impresses they sounded hollow) the skullcrushers, or the bose. They beat them all, looking and feeling good

     <Review>Pros: Great price, great sound, comfortable.

Cons: Son can&apos;t hear me calling him from the other room...

After shopping around and testing several different sets of headphones we chose these not just for the price but for the sound quality and bass. They have excellent sound reproduction, almost as good as the overpriced Beats. The bass was definitely deeper and hit harder than the Beats headphones and the price was a fraction of the cost. We did have an issue with the first set when someone yanked the headphones off my sons head at school and one of the earpieces stopped working within a week of buying them. Easy solution with the replacement set...they stay at home...or with me. :)</Review>

     <Review>Definitely a headphone for all you bass heads out there. Awesome for the price, the sound quality is amazing, sounds like I have some subs attached to my ears and I can hear all that bass I&apos;ve been missing with other headphones. Comfortable, sturdy, stylish, and they come with an awesome carrying case. Buy these if you are looking for a good pair of headphones for listening to bass music for under $100</Review>

     <Review>Pros: Good price, amazing bass, comfy fit

Cons: Looks a little bulky

I LOVE these headphones.. They&apos;re padded which is great, the bass is incredible, and I find myself more into my music than ever. Everytime I put them on, I just want to dance when a song with amazing bass comes on. They really put into perspective all the things you&apos;re missing when you&apos;re listening to any song!! :D</Review>

     <Review>The MDR-XB500 Headphones are incredible. They sound amazing. I searched far and wide for cheap headphones with respectable bass and these did not disapoint. Overall if you are searching for headphones under 60$ and your main concern is bass these are the best for you. Compared to the Dre Beats these are better. They cost less and deliver comparable quality. They sound a bit better with an amp as these headphones are conservative in their use of power. They are nice and cozy, but when its hot your ears can get a bit sweaty. They are best for bassy genres such as Rap, Hip Hop, and Dubstep. If you do get these put on 16bit - FRZR9000 and at the 55 second mark and you can feel your head LITERALLY shake. The highs and lows are good but the bass. If you want bass BUY THESE.</Review>

Only negative I found is the cord is short ... under 4ft. I would buy them again &amp; I recommend them as well. Thanks.</Review>

     <Review>Pros: Good price, comfortable, bass response, mids, highs

Cons: Carrying case, lack of features, a little large

It seems to be a trend nowadays for people, especially teens, to buy headphones based on their bass response. Headphone fanatics and audiophiles bash this trend saying that it is killing what music is supposed to sound like. Well, bass lovers, audiophiles, I have some great news, there is some middle ground!

Now, I am not saying that these are going to please the most particular audiophiles, but I will say that these are easily some of the best headphones for under $100. As usual, I will break it down in terms of sound quality (lows, mids, and highs), comfort, and durability.

Sound Quality:
Lows: The name says it all, these have the boomiest, yet cl ... ean, bass you can possibly find in a pair of headphones. Even into the lower octaves, the bass remains smooth. This comes with some downfalls because the bass can drown out some of the music at times, but simply setting your listening device to a &quot;Treble Boost&quot; EQ will easily fix this problem.

Mids: Very warm and pleasing to the ears. The bass can drown them out at times, but a simple EQ selection will fix that right up.

Highs: Very accurate and well replicated without being too harsh. You won&apos;t be cringing at every cymbal crash and hand clap.

Cofmort: The over-sized memory foam ear cushions make for a pleasing listening experience. These things literally feel like clouds. This is by far the most comfortable set of headphones I have ever worn. They are also surprisingly lightweight. Even after long listening periods, I felt no discomfort or heat problems.

Durability: Although they are made out of plastic, they definitely don&apos;t feel fragile by any means. Very well built overall, but since the case provided is only a cloth case, you have to be careful when carrying them around.

Now for some side notes: There is no 1/4 inch adapter, so you&apos;re stuck using anything with the stereo mini input. Also, as I listed before, the carrying case is not very reassuring. These do leak noise as well, so I would not recommend them fo ...

     <Review>Pros: THE SUPER THICK and BROAD Soundstage

Cons: I went through 3 pairs of others before finding these..

Well. All-righty then. I&apos;m in love with these things. I use an iPod touch and with the Acoustic preset I&apos;m completely and totally satisfied. They are quite fat, super wide, and expansive to say the least. They are a bit bass heavy with a flat EQ , but then they are extra bass phones, yes?? The sensitivity is great, I&apos;m impressed. I need mid level volume to drive them for average listening ONLY. They get quite loud and maintain their sound quite nicely. Actually they are meant to be driven a bit I assume as the highs and mids come up out of the bass and I&apos;m still only 3/4ths the way up on my volume. Weaker players will have ZERO problems driving these and home systems will ... be just that much thicker. After even a few minutes of listening you&apos;ll likely be spoiled as they truly add thick and CLEAN bass and present such a FULL soundstage without the need for empty sounding bass boost settings.

I listen to broad range of stuff which these cover incredibly. Even older stuff and kind of thin stuff sound really well. I go fom Basia, Keiko Matsui to the extreme of Pantera type stuff and these are really one-EQ-setting-does-it-all phones. You&apos;ll hear the shortcomings of poorly produced stuff as well as be blow away with the great works..

Being a headphone nut and having finicky ears I can FULLY recommend these for full-time phones- as long as you&apos;re okay with the look.. I don&apos;t even care with sound like these things generate. For those that think it&apos;s overkill- Heck with Em&apos;!! Trust me- They&apos;ll have NO CLUE as to what is transpiring between your ears..

The 4ft cord is perfect for portable use and it&apos;s a flat and wide ribbon-type that will NOT likely short out. These things are made very well and the cushy ear cups are supposed to be soft and plush- they isoloate the sound well enough, the sound is so thick that they can&apos;t help but block out noise.. And the fact that the earcups unscrew from the bad is cool- when the cord gets all warped, which they always do, just take em&apos; ...

     <Review>These headphones are fantastic. The bass is wonderful. It&apos;s like there are two subs right next to your ears. They always tell you to not turn it up to loud, but on occasion, do. It will blow your mind. The cord is nice and short, easy to deal with. The carrying pouch is a great thing to have too. If you are a classic rock fan, or a indie kid, that kind of music doesn&apos;t sound as good with these headphones. However, if you like hip- hop, or electronic music, or anything with lots of bass, you will soon fin yourself in heaven. They are by far the best headphones for &lt;$100. A great buy.</Review>

     <Review>Pros: Big, Clean sound from top to bottom. AWESOME Bass.

Cons: I haven&apos;t figured out the &quot;not so great&quot; part yet.

There are better headphones out there -- if you want to spend a lot more money. If you&apos;re in the sub-$100 range, I don&apos;t think you can do much better. I have more expensive headphones that will only gather dust now. These were an impulse buy after I hooked them to my smart phone in the store. The are great on my Creative Zen mp3 player, and totally awesome on my PC. I shook them down with a variety of dubstep, rock, pop, etc. The ultimate test came with Bass Addiction and Bass Mekanik. These &apos;phones produce big, clean sound from bottom to top -- no mud, boom, or tin. Pure joy for eighty bucks. I&apos;m hearing bass that I never heard before, without blowing my ears and ... brains out. The response range of the drivers allows reproduction to to sub-audible frequencies, but you can still feel it. I might buy a nice $300 set of headphones someday, but that purchase has been postponed indefinitely. The Sony MDR-XB500 is just plain GOOD. That&apos;s the final answer from an audiophile sorta guy with eclectic musical tastes, particularly for a 58 year-old bass freak who has listened to LOTS of stuff over the decades. In addition to thunderous, clean bass, I want clean repro to the top. Again -- You can spend LOTS more and get something better, but I&apos;m just plain tickled with this $80 purchase. Getcha the Sony MDR-XD500 headphones. Plug &apos;em into your PC or your &apos;Pod, or mp3 player and get happy.

     <Review>Pros: BASS

Cons: they are huge.

alright i know people are always skeptical of reviews. but i truly am an audiophile. so listen. these headphones are phenomenal, considering what they are. they ARE extra bass, there is TONS of bass. and if you hook these up to an amp, oh my it gets loud. they are considerably crisp with the mids and highs considering they are suppose to be extra bass. if you are a avid listener of dubstep, hip-hop, or any bass-heavy type of music, you have to get these headphones. ESPECIALLY for dubstep, because if you really want the full effect from dubstep, you have to have powerful bass. and these headphones definitely have powerful bass. if you listen to rock, classical, and other types of music where bass is not the focus, these headphones can still get ... the job done very well, but there are better headphones for the job. these headphones are hands down the most comfortable headphones i have ever used. and if you want a comparison, (and this is completely non-bias) i was listening to to these headphones, took them off, and put on a pair of beats by dre solos. THEY SOUNDED AWFUL compared to these headphones. honestly there is no comparison. BUY THESE HEADPHONES IF YOU LOVE BASS!

     <Review>Pros: Super deep bass, big cusions are very comfy, very nice design.

Cons: my eardrums are about to explode.. srsly

I was searching for a very good pair of headphones for almost 1 year and finally my search is over. This headphone is a BEAST! actually it sounded like a $300 headphones like dr. dre&apos;s but this Sony XB is much better. The bass is very very deep, 4hz deep! without distorting the mids and highs. This headphone is very good for bass songs like hip hop and trance (it will shake your head). The big cushions are VERY COMFORTABLE! that i can wear it for 2 days straight lol. and also the flat cord design is very nice. The two down side for these headphones are the short cord and the sound leak. But overall this is a very very good product. If you are a BASS HEAD like me ... , then this is your heaven. Best Headphones Ever! period!

     <Review>Pros: SOUND, PRICE, COMFORT! A++++

Cons: Not sound canceling but pretty darn close for price!!!

I just bought these headphones and now are trying them, I gave them a test on all levels, first on XM satellite radio stations: talk radio was great and clear, then went to Hip hop/rap sounded great wow nice thump, then I used my mobile phone for music and videos. WOW! haven&apos;t had a pair of these type of headphones for awhile, the construction is nice, good quality on the headset part, looked over the construction of the over the ear muffs. the outer is very soft and comfortable when putting them on, its like wearing a headphones with pillows. the headset to move is not flimsy so you can fit on your head. I did push the limits of these headphones next with hard rock blasting and hi ... gh and lows of bass hit hard and felt air poofing outside the earphones. WOW nice punch for this price point of these headphones, it comes with a nice pouch for the headphones and the wire from the heaphones to the jack is a nice flat cord, looks to me that it won&apos;t fray after multiple use. This is a definite BEST BUY!

     <Review>Spectacular deep bass, immersive sound quality, beautiful design, and great comfort. The Sony Extra Bass headphones achieve all of these attributes easily. These headphones present an acoustic epiphany between your ears. The Sony MDR-XB500 Extra Bass headphones deliver pulsating bass performance and vocal clarity that represent the finest technological achievement in the headphones product category. This pair of Sony MDR-XB500 audiophile headphones offers ultimate comfort with its highly adjustable headband and plush pillow quality ear cushions that cover the most advanced 40mm headphone drivers on the planet. I am unable to hear other outside distractions in my immediate environment when wearing the Sony headphones. The Sony MDR-XB500 headphones are so comfortable that it is just di ... sappointing to remove them after an exhilarating and lengthy private listening session. The concert quality sonic experience offered by these Sony headphones makes me feel as if a live band is performing right in front of me. No matter what musical preference you have, the sound reproduction emanating from this beautifully designed pair of headphones is so wonderful, that there is no comparison with other headphone brands. The extraordinary and prodigious bass output of these Sony MDR-XB500 Extra Bass headphones is addictive. In my judgment, the audio sounds better through this pair of headphones than a stereo system playing through Hi-Fi loudspeakers. The Sony Extra Bass headphones sport an attractive appearance with its large design, cloth covered headband, silver ear cup exterior finish, and flat Y-type cord. Of course, the Sony MDR-XB500 headphones feature a 3.5mm gold-plated, L-shaped stereo mini plug for maximum signal transfer and compatibility with the widest range of portable, MP3, and home audio equipment possible. The headphones come packaged with a very high quality carrying case for storage or safe transport to another destination. I primarily use the Sony MDR-XB500 Extra Bass headphones with my Sony CFD-G700CP boombox to achieve out-of-this-world exact sound performance. With its world class bass performance, exceptional midrange, and stunning vocals, the Sony MDR-XB500 Extra Bass headphones embody the ultimate portable audio accessory. Good Luck. Enjoy.

     <Review>Pros: Incredible bass and highs at extremely loud volume

Cons: short cord

I&apos;ve experiemented with numerous pairs of headphones. The Dr. Dre&apos;s, The Skull Crushers w/Sub woofer box, and bose in-ear&apos;s, and finally I found the Sony Extra Bass Headphones.

They were a little too tight for comfort the first few times i put them on, but now they seem to fit just right. Also the cable that comes with the headphones is rather short. I caught myself tugging on the computer when i leaned back and the cable stretched.

The low on these headphones is obsolutely sick! I run my music through 2 different systems to get the loudest possible volume to my ears and these headphone manage the bass perfectly. These headphones with enough low end added on the EQ make even bootleg audio ... recordings sound studio.

I dont think I can find any better headphones than these. I havnt heard one song or recording through these things that IS NOT the best i&apos;ve ever heard it played back. Perfect price for perfect sound!

These are great for hip hop and rock. They are a little snug but all in all, some decent cans for the price. If you are looking for some punch in your music and don&apos;t care too much about hearing every little sound with perfect clarity, get &apos;em.</Review>

     <Review>Pros: Great Bass,Great Deal,Super Comfortable

Cons: A Little Bulky

Im a 15 year old boy who&apos;s birthday just came up and I couldn&apos;t think of anything to get. I never looked at headphones as much before, at first I thought to get beats pros because there the most expensive and I thought the best are the most expensive but I was way wrong. I went to bestbuy and was very disappointed at how heavy they were and how uncomfortable the ear cups were. I saw these baby&apos;s and saw that it had extra bass. I hooked them up to my iPod and immediately fell in love with these. The price is unbeatable for the quality of these headphones believe me they won&apos;t disappoint.</Review>

     <Review>Pros: Amazing Bass. The Sound Is Very Crisp And Clear. Good Value.

Cons: Treble Gets A Bit Muddy. Very Claustrophobic.

I bought these headphones on a whim. At first I loved them, the bass is super rich and clear. Dubstep has never sounded better :) However, if you listen mainly to rock or any music with notes in more of the mid/high range, these might not be for you. Sometimes vocals get a bit muddy and drowned out by the instruments. A lot of my grunge now has a treble equalizer on it, which has made the sound for these headphones much better. Also, they are very tight and conforming around the ear so they can get claustrophobic! All in all, they are a great value and the bass is fantastic, however, they do have some drawbacks.</Review>

     <Review>Pros: Comfort and bass

Cons: Quality

Originally purchased the Sennheiser HD-205 because I was turned away by the quality of the MDR-XB500 when seeing them in the store. The Sennheiser was, like many other reviews indicate, too tight and subsequently uncomfortable.

The next day I returned to Best Buy to return the Sennheiser for the MDR-XB500 and I am extremely pleased. I actually listen to a lot of rap music, so the extra bass does wonders.

Anything without a lot of intended bass needs an equalizer change to hear some of the other highs and mids since the bass is so apparent.</Review>

     <Review>Pros: Great sound quality

Cons: short cord

These Sony headphones are great quality for the price. I bought this for $55 last year at FYE music store. I think the original price was almost $80. The sound quality is amazing very clear and crisp. The bass is just fantastic. It makes you get lost in your music. No matter what music you are playing it definitely gives a nice rich sound without the ruffled sound if the volume is up too high. The ear cups are very comfortable that fits well over the earlobes. They are also not heavy and does not bog down on one&apos;s ears. However,after a while it tends to get a little warm around my ears if I had the headphones on for quite a while. The wire is not very long so you cant be roaming around if hooked up to a laptop or desktop. One does ha ... ve to adjust the EQ if you do not like the default settings. It has lasted me for over a year now so it is without a doubt durable. If you have the volume on to the sound does travel outside of the headphones so people nearby can hear what you are listening to.

     <Review>The XB500 delivers very deep subwoofer-style bass that is uncommon in most headphones. Because they use more traditional 40mm drivers (unlike it&apos;s big brother the XB700) it retains a bit more punch in addition to solid deep bass. But because it uses the 40mm driver instead of the 50mm driver in the XB700, the bass does not go as low and there is a bit of negative impact on the midrange during heavy bass. No worse than other 40mm headphones however. The ear cups are the same soft cushions as found on the XB700, except they are smaller. It&apos;s just a bit too small to completely surround my ears but a bit too big to comfortable rest on my ears. It rests on just the outer edge of my ears which feels odd. When I use them I fold my ear lobes so they fit inside the cushion and that is the bes ... t way I&apos;ve found so far. I don&apos;t really have big ears. These are excellent for portable use, and sound great without the need for equalization. At 40 ohms they are very easy to drive.

     <Review>Was looking for headphones for my teenager for Christmas for him to use with his ipod touch and cell phone. I looked at th beats by Dre but to be honest, the price for them was more than I could rationalize and the reviews were mixed, so I started from scratch with my reviews. I decided on this pair based on the high reiews and the quantity of positive reviews on Best Buy&apos;s site.

My son LOVES them! He said the bass was unbelievable and that the ear phones were comfortable. My husband and I listened and were definitely pleased with the sound. I even plugged them into my cell phone (Samsung Epic) and the sound was still impressive! I would definitely recommend them to anyone looking for good sound, lots of bass, and comfortable fit!</Review>

     <Review>Pros: Comfort, Sound Quality, durable cord, easy to open box (pull from top)

Cons: nothing, unless they break

I&apos;ve purchased countless brands of headphones and earbuds. Skullcandy had been my current favorite. The Skullcandy Titan earbuds are great, but they don&apos;t last in the long run. The Skullcandy Hesh DJ are an excellent choice for all genres of music, but plastic head adjustments leads to problems with durability. Then, there are Klipsch Image S4, which were good, but again no quality. I had purchased the Skullcandy skullcrushers to find a better bass in my highs and mids, but instead i brought them back to get this Sony MDR-X500s, they are very comfortable and sound amazing with almost any genre of music you use.

Sound Quality: If you&apos;re computer has a good sound ... card and you play WOW, COD, or Csource, you will like their amazing bass depth, as well as its sound from rap and r&amp;b. These headphones are very good value for money, as they sound as good as Dr. Dre beats in my opinion.

Durability and Comfort: Most of my headphones last 6 to 8 months with heavy usage, these look like they are better quality than some more expensive ones. These headphones are also very comfortable, sometimes i don&apos;t even feel them on my head, there is the bass to remind me.

Overall:

     <Review>I primarily use these headphones for listening to music while I work. I have traditionally been a Bose fan, but my finances would not support another pair of Triports. On the positive side, headphones are very comfortable, even wearing glasses. I can wear them for hours at a time. The sound is good, the extra bass is a little bit misleading. They have good bass, but it&apos;s not overwhelming. Sound is fairly well balanced. Headphones are quite light for their size.Negatives include a bit of muddy mid-range in certain types of music. Here is where the Bose blow these out of the water. However, I can buy 3 pair of these for 1 pair of Bose, so I try to keep it relative.Overall, I&apos;d recommend these for $50-60. If I had to pay the [$] retail I would just spring for the Triports.</Review>

     <Review>Pros: Good Bass; Good Value; Lightweight; Great Sound; Durable; Stylish; Comfortable

These headphones are awesome. I have absolutely loved them since the first song played through them. The bass is unbelievable; from what I&apos;ve experienced the bass level is on par or better than the $300 dr. dre&apos;s. They are extremely comfortable, wearing them for hours at a time is no problem. Build quality is top notch and they feel very well built. For the price I doubt they can be beaten. These are a great performing headphone and I highly recommend them.</Review>

     <Review>These babies rock! Deep defined bass even with my tiny Panasonic Go...playing for 10 hours straight during my shift only uses half my charge. They don&apos;t need a lot of power but when you give them some juice they kick and boom. Very smooth sound and clear. I have not heard the more expensive brand headphones but I cant imagine those sounding any better but for this price these are fantastic. Also very comfy.</Review>

     <Review>When purchasing quite anything from SONY, you are always in for a great product that&apos;ll last long and for a reasonable price! After about 2-3 weeks of use I&apos;ve got to say, these are not only the most comfortable pair of headphones I&apos;ve ever worn but also, you can tell they&apos;ll last. As I am writing this review, I am using the XB-500&apos;s and I can say, their Bass is Amazing and not to mention, their mid&apos;s and high&apos;s aren&apos;t all that bad to the point where you can basically listen to just about any genre on them! Also if you&apos;re on a low budget or just don&apos;t want to spend so much money on headphones, these are the perfect choice i&apos;d recommend, but even with such a low price they&apos;re comparison to other headphones, Bose or Dr. Dre Beats, they&apos;re simply incredible! I&apos;ve also read a couple of the oth ... er reviews saying, &quot;Don&apos;t wear in public! They atract to much attention!&quot; and I would have to gladly disagree, sure they are big, who cares! Their Clarity is astounding, and their comfort are uncomparable to any other headphones and if anyone tries to say less, let them try them on, they&apos;ll immediately know they were wrong. At first people may recognize you because of them but they&apos;ll soon forget because that&apos;s just about how everything else works out. So, if your looking for some great priced headphones yet with some nice bass and quality, you&apos;re definately going to want to check these out! ...

     <Review>Birthday gift from my wife - but I hinted. I have used stereo headphones for over 50 years. This is my best pair yet. Smooth sounding response. Great bass -solidly there but not boomy or distorted. Very comfortable also. Good but not perfect external sound isolation. Negatives: Needs a longer cord.</Review>

These are the best headphones for the price I&apos;ve ever bought. Quality of sound and bass is excellent. The ear covers are oversized enough to cover entire ear. The ear cushions are very soft and squishy (aka comfortable). I&apos;m extremely satisified with this puchase.</Review>

     <Review>Pros: comfortable, good sound quality and bass

Cons: nothing, it&apos;s absolutely great

I spent a long time looking for the perfect headphones. I started with some 20 dollar Sony over the ear headphones from walmart and they were horrible, then I purchased panasonic dj street headphones from best buy, they were ok but very uncomfortable and plasticky.

Then I bought Sennheiser around the ear 40 dollar headphones, they were good but the sound leaked a lot and you needed to raise the volume a lot for an average volume, so then I bought the Sennheiser around the ear 80 dollar headphones, thinking it might solve the problem, but they were evidently the same except with better sound quality.

After that I purchased the bose ae2 150 dollar headphones, they were really good ... sound quality, but they are quite pricey and the bass wasn&apos;t great, and that&apos;s when after purchasing and returning so many different headphones, I bought these sony headphones, and they were great, the sound quality and bass are great, and they&apos;re at a reasonable price, I like that the chord is not long since I only use them with my laptop and ipod.

     <Review>I&apos;m a musician and naturally love listening to music while doing whatever. I bought these headphones here on B&amp;H after trying them out at a store in my town. To be honest when the sales rep told me the price I was blown away as i&apos;ve heard comparable quality from headphones 4 times the price. Pros and Cons...They are EXTREMEMLY comfortable. Laying down with them on is one of my favorite ways to use them. The audio quality is a huge step up from earbud headphones and definitely beat the skullcandy extra bass phones which seemed overwhelming and had muffled vocals. I actually think these are even better than sonys noise cancelling headphones which seem to make your head feel its going to explode from the vaccum seal. I personally EQ the bass down and the treble up a hair on my ipod which ... is as easy as picking the treble booster equalizer setting and they sound GREAT. So much detail comes through that you&apos;ll never hear with earbuds. For the cons...i&apos;m not much of a complainer in general and I am totally satisfied. I would just watch if you&apos;re looking to buy them for recording you&apos;ll need another cord to extend the length as the cord on these is only long enough for computer or mp3 player use.

     <Review>Pros: bass

Cons: cheap quality, plastic headband

used these two weeks, dropped them, broke the piece(plastic) that holds the ear phone to the headband. Took them to Midland Michigan store, they would not replace or refund my money. POOR CUSTOMER SERVICE! I was told that I should have purchased the extended warranty plan, it covers accidents. Will NOT be seen in MIDLAND MICHIGAN store again!! Shame on you!</Review>

     <Review>I was impressed by these headphones the first time I put them on. The bass is awesome especially when listening to bass enhanced music. Not that you need any enhancement to make these sound incredible. At [$] B&amp;H has by far the lowest price.</Review>

     <Review>These headphones have such an incredible sound and the bass is very excellent, just as described. BY FAR these are the best headphones on the market in this price range. The one downside is that sound leaks. The leaks mostly occur from the three small openings on the outside of the headphones. I&apos;m not totally sure why they are there, but I put a piece of electrical tape right over it and the leakage was minimal and I sacrificed no sound quality. I highly recommend these, but take care of the leakage!</Review>

     <Review>Pros: Sound quality, comfort

Cons: Nothing that I can find

I have been looking for a solid pair of headphones for a while. However, I couldn&apos;t justify spending $200-$300 on headphones. I started looking at BestBuy.com looking at different brands and paying special attention to customer reviews. This product has such good reviews and the price was very good. I rock out to music at work since I&apos;m at a computer all day. As soon as I put these on I noticed the comfort. Extremely soft cushioning. When the music started, I was hooked. Excellent sound and outstanding bass and it was all coming out of my iPhone! Take a pass on Beats by Dre and buy a quality product with a great price. I&apos;m telling you, these are worth it!</Review>

     <Review>Pros: Powerful Bass, Price

Cons: Nope, nothing at all.

I went ahead and plugged in my mp3 to the demo headsets they had out and was amazed on the powerful bass and sound quality it produced. To me, its perfect for rock and dupstep( mostly dubstep) as the bass steals the show for a great price and with no faults as of now.</Review>

     <Review>Pros: Very deep bass, very comfortable, affordable, durable, can wear for hours,

Cons: Nothing

i was just browsing at best buy and i saw these head phones becuse the looked vey comfortable and had a lot of bass and i listened to Yonkers by Tyler the Creator on some Skrillex and i have never heard any more bass in my life. The chord is very durable and does not break at the ends easily. Dre Beats will never come close to the quality of these. and the price of these are much cheaper too. bottom line is if you are looking for headphoness with a lot of bass and good quality this is what you are looking for. A MUST HAVE</Review>

     <Review>Pros: Reproduces the low frequency bass very well. Great Price

Cons: Bulky

I have been DJing for twenty years and have had many headphones. Everything from Sony, Shure, Sennheiser, AKG, Numark, Audio-Technica, Stanton, Denon, American Audio, Nady, and Bose. I always came back to Sony because of the sound quality you get for the price. I have never needed the noise-cancellation because I always have one earphone off anyway. Now I own three headphones: Sony, Beats by Dre, and Bose. If you are considering Beats by Dre, then save your money and buy these. They certainly give Dre (Monster) a run for his money. When it comes to low frequency modulation, these things reproduce it so well that they almost jump off of your ears. If you need noise-cancelling, then these are not for you ... . That&apos;s where the Bose comes in. You won&apos;t hear ANY outside noise with the Bose headphones.
In conclusion, if you are searching Best Buy for headphones, you can stop looking, these are the ones you want. If you want bass, these are the ones you want. If you want to pay a lot of money for the nearly the same sound quality, then buy Beats by Dre. If you need superior noise cancellation buy BOSE!!!

If Mr. Zone Four said it... It&apos;s true!

Cons: Durability could be a bit better.

These have got to be the best headphones I have ever used. They have INCREDIBLE bass and very clear sound! Also the ear cushions on them are amazing and it&apos;s so comfortable after awhile you barely notice you have them on. Kudos to Sony for making these excellent headphones! If you are even considering buying these headphones.. DO IT!! Totally worth the price.</Review>

     <Review>Pros: It has RADICAL Bass, amazing comfort, solid design, did I mention COMFORT?

Cons: Cable length may be an issue to some -- it&apos;s probably around 27&quot;-34&quot; long

I&apos;m always in the market for a set of headphones of all shapes and sizes. So when I saw these I was really excited, actually I&apos;ve always enjoyed the quality for price that Sony has offered on Headphones -- I picked these up without even listening to them first. Extremely confident that I had made a great purchase I hurried home to unwrap my new pair to add to the collection.

These headphones are really the way to go. Unless you have $500.00+ for a proper pair of headphones you will be hard pressed to find something in the same category for a similar price.

I do have a couple suggestions that could make t ... he next generation of these. I would prefer that the Auxiliary cable be detachable with short-medium-long length cables as an accessory (included or not). Taking on the same approach that Beats and super high quality companies do.

     <Review>does not eliminate outside noise, only covers up, you can hear everything that is around you, until you turn up the noise. but they don&apos;t claim to. they have awesome sound and, BASS! does it have it! they are ugly af, but im not the one of those people that shows off their headphones in public, so thats not a problem, comfort is also amazing, feels pretty cheap, but just take care of them. defiantly best headphones in their price range</Review>

     <Review>Pros: Bass Booms, Comfortable, No amp needed, Works great with ipod, better than beats 100%, amazing price.

Cons: My brother has had no problems, so they&apos;re awesome!

I heard about these headphones from my 19 year old brother ( hes a dj) and i was at his house for christmas when he got these headphones and i got the beats by dr dre studio headphones. I loved my studios for approximately .. ONE hour when my parents surprised my brother with these headphones. I immediately felt bad for him because hes a dj and didnt get beats but in his opinion he was like, &quot;Little bro, beats suck&quot; but hey, all my friends had beats so why not? Everything changed when he said hey come check these out. I immediately fell in love and listened to them for an hour and a half and put my studios down. ... Now my beats are packed up in the apple bag and ready to be sent back.. ANDDD the sony mdr xb500s.. are on there way to my house. Sound quality of these sony headphones is greatttt~! Bass booms in ur ear and vibrates ur whole cheek! also in the studios on some soungs the bass would drown out the whole music! but in the sonys there perfect! Get these now!!!

     <Review>Pros: Good price and comparable with headphones more expensive than them

Cons: a bit big

These headphones are amazing!!
THe cushions on them are so amazing i could wear these for hours. The highs mids and lows are fantastic. The cable never tangles and i dont have a problem with the length i would say they are about as long as apple headphones. They are very comfortable and are better than headphones even more expensive than them. I definatly recommend if you dont want to spend $300+ for beats. I use an EQ on mine but even without using an EQ on them they are great! I recommend these to anyone. My only con is they are a bit big but for me its not a terrible problem.</Review>

     <Review>Pros: Bass like Dre Beats for a fraction of the cost

Cons: They are not leather.

In short, I bought the Dre Beats because of all the reviews that said they have AWESOME Bass. Well little did I know that all of the people that said that were basing their opinion off the store display and did not really own them. So I bought them. That was a mistake.
In a few short days I learned that these Sony XB500&apos;s had just as much Bass as the Beats By Dre for one quarter of the price. The Beats only sound good on the store display because they are pumping a lot of wattage in to that &quot;Boom Boom Pow&quot; display. When plugged in to a regular iPod these Sound every bit as good as the beats did.
Hats off to Sony for making a product and charging a reasonable price for it and not getting som ... e rapper celebrity to slap their name on it for an additional 225 dollars. Leave those to the sheep and the G-money hommies that rate style and trendiness above value. Smart people will buy these Sony&apos;s.

     <Review>I bought these on sale for $40 at BestBuy around 2 years ago and didn&apos;t expect much. I was blown away when I got home and put them on for the first time. The only thing that I noticed was the small hunger for a little more bass while listening to heavy bass genres such as Dubstep or Rap. Being a Winnipeg boy i&apos;ve worn these in thunderstorms, blizzards, extreme cold, extreme heat and they still look and sound mint. Super comfortable for for long listens like Pink Floyd seshes. Most amazing experience i&apos;ve ever had with these was one time when I ate 7 grams of mushrooms alone and put on the XB500s. The first song I put on was Warning by Ajapai and as some may think this would be a terrible song choice it became a defining moment in my life and one of my greatest experiences to date. My paren ... ts bought me Dre Beats STUDIOS for christmas and I still use the XB500. Even though there is much more bass in the Beats, the clarity, overall sound, and comfort is greater in the XB500.

     <Review>Pros: Big but well-balanced sound, extremely comfortable, affordable.

Cons: Nothing.

I was looking for a set of over-the-ear headphones to replace my earbuds because I got tired of jamming them into my ears all the time. I wasn&apos;t looking to spend a crazy amount of money so I first tried the Skullcandy Hesh. While they were very comfortable they just didn&apos;t have a very full sound. I understand that a pair of headphones in that price range isn&apos;t going to sound like a set that costs several hundred dollars, but they were definitely lacking nonetheless. After some research online I decided to give these Sony headphones a try. I am blown away by how great these sound for something at this price point. They advertise these as &quot;extra bass&quot; but I think they actually sound quite balan ... ced. While the bass is most definitely there, it&apos;s not so intense that it will rattle your brains. The sound quality really is amazing from top to bottom. And they are ridiculously comfortable as well thanks to the big and plush earpads. As far as durability goes, they don&apos;t seem like they will fall apart as long as you don&apos;t beat them up. I am sure there is stuff out there that would hold up to more abuse, but these seem like they are made fairly well. If you don&apos;t really want to throw down hundreds of dollars for a high-end set of headphones but you want big sound and comfort...you really can&apos;t go wrong with these. I highly recommend them.

     <Review>For the price of the headphones, their worth every penny. Thumping bass with good clarity, super sized muffs=super comfortable and drown outside sound, but get a bit too hot after extended use. Flat wires coming off each side, but they don&apos;t tangle easily which is a nice change. I&apos;ve only had these headphones less than a month but every time I put them on, which is almost daily, the sony&apos;s put me in another world listening to music.</Review>

     <Review>I have been looking for a good pair of headphones lately, not just good, but great! After looking around different websites and stores, I compared these headphones to the Beats by Dr. Dre and I have to tell you, these sound way better and are much cheaper. After all the frequency response on these headphones are much wider than most other headphones in its class, giving you superb low bass, mids, and crisp highs. I have even fallen asleep with these on because they were so comfortable and I didn&apos;t have to wake up in pain; some of you may know what I am talking about. The only con is that the sounds leaks a bit, so other people can hear what you are listening to; its not a big issue for me though. These headphones are sturdy, comfortable enough to sleep in, and sound good enough to brag abo ... ut to your friends who spent hundreds on Bose or Dr. Dre Beats :). Compared to more expensive headphones, these give you the most bang for your buck.

     <Review>Pros: SOUND IS THE BEST

Cons: doesn&apos;t fit good in heat

I bought these for myself a few weeks ago. I just recently got a job, so i decided to get something nice for myself. i bought these because i tried them in store in the display. they sounded PERFECT. the bass is excellent, the treble is phenomenal. the overall sound is amazing. the only flaw is, if you are outside, the heat will cause the headphone to actually no fit in place, so you lose all the bass and sound quality, because the headphones don&apos;t fit perfectly</Review>

     <Review>Pros: sound quality, price, BASS

Cons: headband comfort and durability

Very comfortable headphones, especially for the price. I bought these headphones today and have been using them all day. The cushion earphones allow great noise isolating quality. Sound quality is better than what you pay for. Very deep and full Bass that is great. I purchase ear buds about every other month and I have a feeling I won&apos;t need to know because I have these. Only thing I am nervous about is headband durability. Feels like it might break easily. Also, don&apos;t recommend working out in these. Since they are over the ear and form a good barrier, they can make you sweat around the ears easily.</Review>

     <Review>Pros: long lasting amazing

Cons: N/A

These headphones are one of a kind. i have been using these amazing headphones for 7 months now without a problem.these headphones are good quality, and have epic bass. i would rather pay 70 - 80$, then to have to go out and buy cheap and bad quality headphones that would have to replaced evrey 2-3 weeks! meaning if i were to buy 1 10$ dollar headphone, it would only last me 2 weeks, plus it has bad sound quality with no bass.so if i were to spend 10$ evrey 2 weeks i would be spendin 20$ a month on bad quality not good feeling headphones. for that i go out and buy these epic headphones that feel like you have 2 pillows on each end of your ear.

To wap things up go with these headphones not some bad brand 10$ headphones, out wont regr ... et it!!!

I was really impressed by the quality of sound on these headphones, and the Bass is, of course, amazing. I have had my pair for over ten months now, and they still look and perform like new. Also, they are like a couch for your head. They can be worn for hours without discomfort, and it is easy to forget that they are even there.</Review>

     <Review>Pros: Wonderful Sound!

Cons: Nothing!

I purchased these headphones about a month ago. I have nothing horrid to say about them at all. They are AMAZING! I listen to a huge variety of music, but these headphones bring out the entire spectrum of sound in a crisp and clear notion.
The cushioned headphones are also a plus! Totally soft and comfortable for hours of endless use.

The heavy bass is amazing; especially for dance music and hip-hop.

Definitely worth it. Protection plan is a must!</Review>

     <Review>Im a 15 year old boy who&apos;s birthday just came up and I couldn&apos;t think of anything to get. I never looked at headphones as much before, at first I thought to get beats pros because there the most expensive and I thought the best are the most expensive but I was way wrong. I went to bestbuy and was very disappointed at how heavy they were and how uncomfortable the ear cups were. I saw these baby&apos;s and saw that it had extra bass. I hooked them up to my iPod and immediately fell in love with these. The price is unbeatable for the quality of these headphones believe me they won&apos;t disappoint.</Review>

Cons: A bit pricy

I just bought these headphones today and so far I&apos;m sufficiently impressed. For a mid-range price you get quality sound. If all you&apos;re looking for is a booming bass, these may not be for you. However, if you want crisp sound quality with a solid thump to it these are for you.</Review>

     <Review>Pros: Great sound quality

These closed headphones will run for your money. They have extremely good balance, and their comfort is definitely taken part of the design of these headphones. The Sony MDR-XB500 is something I would recommend for someone, at least for the entry level of earphones that want to experience closed headphones. They&apos;re not exactly like Sennheiser&apos;s closed headphone selection, but these earphones at least won&apos;t make your ears feel like they&apos;re in a suction vacuum everytime you wear them, or take them off. The bass response is good, and the range I have no problems with. They definitely do not compete against high end headphones, but they&apos;re a good entry level headphone for anyone that wants to spend a bit of money to see how good headphones are. The build is sol ... id, and the cushions are actually pretty nice compared to others I&apos;ve tried. They&apos;re not portable, since they cannot fold up, so I expect these to be only for desktop usage. Overall, this is a recommended buy.

     <Review>Pros: Great Price, Great Sound

So, I&apos;ve heard the Dre Beats, and while they&apos;re good, these are better and more cost efficient. Amazing bass that allows me to hear every bit of sound my Ipod has to offer. These are comfy, and while some sound leaks when you have them very loud, they can easily be adjusted for whatever setting you need to listen to music in. I recommend these over the high priced Dre Beats.</Review>

     <Review>Pros: everything

Cons: nothing

The quality is great and never distorts! Even when I turned it up all the way playing a bass heavy song, it never sounded bad! Amazing clarity! The bass actually shakes your ears a bit even a little over half way turned up! Also great for studio monitoring if your a dj and very comfortable also. The price is also very reasonable and could be priced higher. The plastic is a little flimsy but they hold up nicely. Get them!</Review>

     <Review>Pros: Great price, insane bass, very comfortable

Cons: Princess Leia look to them

I listen primarily to earbuds because they are cheap and portable. I walked into best buy looking for some BEATS cause i heard a lot about them, but not how much they cost(if you have $300 in your pocket then buy them but thats not the point) so i listened to them and they had great quality. Then i started looking at some other headphones and i stumbled across these. When i listened to these i couldnt really tell a diffrence from the beats. These have great quality and are very comfortable as well because of the huge puffy cups. The only bad thing is that you dont get much noise blockage, but that isnt important to me so these were still great. The best part is that there quality is equal to the ... BEATS and they are over $200 less than them so these are great for anyone on a budget. In case i didnt mention, THE BASS IS INSANE ON THESE! These headphones are a steal and you should buy them if you want quality without the logo and reputation that beats have. These are also are great if you want to look like princess leia because the cups on these are just insanly large.

     <Review>Pros: Accounts for all frequencies, sound quality, and comfort

Cons: not anything

These headphones are phenomenal. Every aspect about them is great. I consider myself an experienced listener, and these are great not just for bass, but other ranges as well. These headphones are able to maintain a quality output of mid-ranges/treble while delivering deep bass. If you are looking for headphones with great bass, snag these; whatever you do, do not get the skull crushers (unless you are a careless bass freak). The skull crushers&apos; bass just drowns out everything ever. And when your subwoofer dies, your left with no bass and horrible sound quality, in re of mid ranges and treble. I primarily listen to rap, although I am pretty balanced, and these headphones suffice for the anything ... in the spectrum of music genres. I read a review earlier that said the bass drowns out everything and I was flabbergasted, considering that what I valued most was the maintaining of the other ranges while having dope bass; it&apos;s just like balanced so perfectly and possesses such clarity with a significant dose bass, which blends very nicely. So that guy was just a silly bassophobe. These are so worth the price, but I mean if you are willing to spend the money then you can buy some beats, although you won&apos;t be attaining much more quality. Oh and these have some sweet features such as a flat cord, deep ear cups for ill acoustics; they&apos;re also just wicked comfy and yeah, buy them.

     <Review>Pros: low bass

Cons: maybe too tight

I bought these headphones to wear at work, where my work area isn&apos;t at all private and I need to cut down on distractions. I have plenty of smaller headphones and more expensive ones that I don&apos;t want to leave at work, so I&apos;m looking for comfort and some sound isolation.

My test listening has hardly been with the kind of music I imagine Sony targeted these for. Sony can&apos;t seem to decide between &quot;extra&quot; bass, &quot;accurate&quot; sound and (on the one page owner&apos;s sheet, &quot;booming bass&quot;). For us traditionalists, I don&apos;t think there&apos;s a response curve to be found anywhwere.

As an audiophile who loves accurate sound, including very low bass, I can only describe my reaction to the sound as &quot;guilty pleasure&quot;. I put on a group saxophone album ... at random, and the lowest notes of the baritone sax came through loud and clear, without overpowering the rest of the group.

I briefly listened to some FM radio, and even the female announcer&apos;s voice (or her surroundings) were bass colored ever so slightly; these phones won&apos;t be good for just anything.

Though bass-heavy, these phones don&apos;t seem to have a &quot;band pass&quot; effect (those car speakers that only seem to boom at one pitch); take that as good or bad depending on your taste.

The headband is a bit tight for my size 7 5/8 head, so I&apos;m not sure I&apos;ll be able to keep them, but I&apos;m going to give them a try-out at work.

     <Review>First off, these headphones are very comfortable because the ear cushions are very soft. You won&apos;t find many ear cushions this soft and squishy. With that said, they do start to hurt but only after about 3 hours of uninterrupted use. The bass is definitely not lacking at all and sounds great for a bass head like me. I listen to a lot of pop/hip hop as well as some alternative rock. The high range is a bit lacking but that&apos;s obviously not the focus of these headphones. For the price, the sound is very good. If you plan on rocking these on campus, just know that they are very big. Flattening the cushions down will help.</Review>

     <Review>Pros: clear sound, puffy and comfortable cushioning, sturdy build, bass

Cons: large cushioning

The MDR-XB500 creates clear audio with extra bass. This extra bass isn&apos;t too overpowering, and all styles of music sound great. I&apos;ve listened to techno, hip hop, and pop rock (like The Script). The ear cushions are a bit large, but it doesn&apos;t bother me. I tried these headphones at my local best buy, and compared it to Beats By Dre Solo HD. They both sounded great, but Sony&apos;s product was more than $100 cheaper. I&apos;m not an audiophile, so I couldn&apos;t tell the difference between the sound in the two headphones.

If you&apos;re a real audiophile, however, get the Solos. From the reviews I&apos;ve read, the Beats are one of the best noise-isolating headphones out there. Using the MDR-XB500 at ... home, I can [barely] hear outside noise, so the Beats are probably better in that aspect. Personally, I don&apos;t think noise-isolation is worth $100 more.

Make your decision by testing headphones at your local best buy.

     <Review>Pros: Bass!!!!!

Cons: You look like princess leah when you wear em

Honostly my only complaints are, they are huge! and the ear pads are a vinyl type material which gets sweaty if its hot. But they sounds great and have a TRUE and deep bass. Now they arent noise canceling, but they do block out alot out back ground noise like earmuffs. They arent as BASSy and deep as the Dre beats (but $80 to $300 for a little bit of sound fidelity, definetly worth it) some people have said the bas isnt very true, but most of them have had an iPod shuffle or nano, i have a sony MP3 player with alot of EQ control, and even with the bass and volume way up it sounds good. Also listening to movies through my surround reciever sound great. So if you have $300 bucks wating to jump out of you pocket ... get some bose or beats, but for the working man.... SONY EXTRA BASS.... oh and always get the protection plan that another pair of headphones for only 15 buks when these ones go out....... what they are gonna go out? but you said they were so great....... They are! but have you ever had a pair a headphones last for two years?

     <Review>Pros: Bass, sound quality, and comfort

Cons: A little bulky, gives you the Princess Leia appearance!

Up until purchasing these I&apos;ve always used earbuds.. A few months ago I went out and bought a pair of &quot;Klipsch&quot;(spelling could be wrong haha) earbuds for $70, they were okay, but obvious problems like lack of bass, constant slipping out of the ear, etc cropped up.
So while at best buy I noticed the beats by dre, tested them out and really liked them, but lacked the 300 dollars!! So I decided to look these headphones up, saw all the positive reviews and purchased them..
Easily the best sound quality I&apos;ve had thus far.. The bass is great and they feel comfortable.. I really wish I would have invested in these first over all the expensive ear buds I had purchased.
I woul ... d recommend these to anyone that doesn&apos;t quite have the 300 dollar budget for the beats

I looked around for headphones alot and I thought I would give these a try and they are very good. They aren&apos;t noise cancellation but you can&apos;t hardly hear anything on the outside. I have a pretty good system in my car and theese headphones deliver the same quality. I was quite surprised by how powerful they were and the lows that I could hear and the rumble of the bass.</Review>

     <Review>Pros: Sound Quality, Comfort, Durability

Cons: None

I am a DJ and have used lots of headphones, but the headphones I was using broke (Bose around the ear headphones) after 3 years of use. When I was looking for headphones this time I wanted to buy the same kind of quality headphones and I wanted to find them at a reasonable price. When I stumbled upon these headphones my first thought was these headphones are pretty big but once I tried them on they were like heaven. The comfort and the sound quality were amazing, I felt like I was at the club when I used these headphones. The bass the Sony&apos;s pull is amazing, they are way more comfortable than the Bose around the ear headphones and the sound quality is the same and even better. I would compare these headphones to the Bose whi ... ch are valued at $125 but these headphones are just $80.

If you are looking for headphones that have an amazing sound quality and feel like pillows on your ears then this is the way to go. Lots of people say the chord is too short but it is perfect. The chord (about 4ft) is long enough for you to listen to your Ipod while its in your pocket so I don&apos;t know why people are complaining. I have been through tons of Headphones and these so far have been the best and the price is simply amazing for the sound quality and comfort you are getting.
SONY EXTRA BASS THE ONLY WAY TO GO!

     <Review>Lets just start by saying if you have a under powered audio device and you are using these headphones you wont get the full bass. When you get something that can push these things to the max they will leave you in aww. The bass is very clear no muffling or distortion. I highly recommend these if you like Rap,Hip-Hop,Dubstep or any music full of bass. These heaphones are 79.99 their way better then beats and so much more comfortable. Great Job Sony</Review>

The headphones are great! I think its one of the best phones you can buy at $79.00 the sound is superb and crisp. I use it everyday and i try it with everything, from music coming form my celphone, to my psvita, I wish I could take them while I drive too. It cancels the outside noise and the headphones are so comfortable to wear... a must buy product!!</Review>

     <Review>In my opinion the words &quot;extra bass&quot; may scare some people off, but truthfully the bass is just deeper and more profound. The entire range of sounds are great, clear, and pronounced very well. The bass is by no means overpowering, it is just a great complement to everything else. The best value for over-the-ear headphones, these measure up toe to toe with Beats but you can save $220.
One common thread I noticed throughout the other reviews was the &quot;short cord,&quot; personally I do not understand the issue, I am 6&apos; 4&quot; and it goes from my pocket to my head with plenty of room to spare, so unless you plan on wrangling cattle or something while listening to music you will be fine.</Review>

The bass on this Sony unit is very impressive. Sound quality is also very good. They are also comfortable to wear. You&apos;re not going to hide anywhere wearing these headphones, but you know that before you buy them. My son listens to them every day and he&apos;s very happy with the purchase. I would highly recommend them.</Review>

     <Review>Pros: Deep Rich Bass That You Can Actually Feel. Very Clean And Crisp.

Cons: Compared To Other Headphones I Have.,The Highs And Mids Due Seem To Be Kind Of Dull

Over all these are a great pair of headphones that seem to be very durable. I have had them for 3 months now, and I have used them for Hours at a time. They still feel relatively new. They look very sleek and stylish. The Flat cord that it features is great for reducing tangles. Their a little big to have them sitting around your neck but that&apos;s no biggie. These things are really good for the price, and hold their own with more expensive headphones.</Review>

     <Review>Pros: Amazingly good sound, durable cord, comfort

Cons: HUGE ear cushions

I am a 15-year-old music lover, and simply put, these are the best headphones. I have had these headphones for 6 months now, as of December of 2009, and they have not bent, snapped, or scratched in any way. The cord is extremely durable, plus it&apos;s tangle-free. But the most important highlight of these is the sound. Fantastic! Prominent bass, clear mids and trebles. I have had no regrets about buying these whatsoever. They are super comfortable. I can wear them for hours on end. The only thing that is negative about these is the huge ear cushions. Even though they are highly comfortable, I suggest that you not wear these in public. Kids might laugh at you.</Review>

Not very expensive and maybe not the best audiophile headphones, but for listening to audio books and talk radio they are great. Nice value for the money. I would sure buy them again.</Review>

Cons: Nothing. So far, so good.

Our 15 year old wanted a set of headphones that sounded good for Christmas and was very happy with this set. They aren&apos;t Dr. Dre&apos;s Beats, but they aren&apos;t $300.00 either.

He said his dub step sounds really good with them.</Review>

     <Review>Pros: Deep, hard-hitting bass, clarity in mid and high ranges

Cons: Could use a little extra padding for top of head

I purchased these headphones after returning the Skull Candy Skullcrushers. Those headphones sounded great on the demo at Best Buy, but when I got home and listened to some songs, the &quot;bass&quot; (which is really just vibrations) overpowered the mids and highs.

Went back to BB today and wanted to try the Sonys. The display didn&apos;t work. So I pulled out the handy dandy iPhone and scoped some reviews. And I figured with BB&apos;s return policy (which is awesome), I could exchange them if I didn&apos;t like them.

I was immediately impressed with these phones. Deep, hard-hitting bass accompanied by clarity in the other ranges. They sound great from soft rock to hip h ... op.

Currently testing the bass with some old school Master P (Ghetto D). Definitely digging it. Only issue I have is that I wish there was some more padding for the top of your head, but no big deal.

     <Review>Pros: everything

Since I tried this headphone in BBuy display, I wanted it but waited till good deal.

Even if you spend $80, you will not regret. Anyone in my family who has tried this one, I have enjoyed seeing them being surprised listening music on this headphone. YES, you will see jaw drop surprise face of people when they try this first time and even more surprise when you tell them that it is under $100.

I have used DrDre beats monster, but as compare to price of $300 &apos;monster&apos;, sony has substitute or I would say better one for at least 70% less price...

If you are a music lover and loves bass in music then go and get one, because this is like two small subwoofers by your ear. Trust me it is worth it.</Review>

Cons: A little outside noise gets through, but not bad.

I bought these for my son for Christmas. He immediately loved them and let me listen to them. The bass is really amazing. I was hearing bass in songs I didn&apos;t remember having bass. There is no noise bleed and they are very comfortable. They were even on sale! We got them for less than $70! highly recommend.</Review>

     <Review>Pros: Good Bass, Comfortable, Price

Cons: Cant think of anything

I use these for listening to music on my Droid Incredible. I was going to buy a pair of Phillips when I saw these and tried them out in the store. The Sony was about $15 more then the Phillips. The Sony set had much nicer base and were Way more comfortable to wear. If you not looking to spend tons of money on a set of headphones but dont want to sacrifice decent sound quality, then you will be happy with these Sony Headphones.</Review>

     <Review>Pros: Base, sound and price

Cons: Headphones make your ears sweat. Not much airflow

Excellent sound quality and base, however everyone around you can hear what your music your playing. I thought these were a little better sound proof but I was wrong. Lot of sweating going on your ears, even just sitting there. I would recommend only if you plan on sitting listening to your music, any type of walking or anything will produce an ear full of sweat from these headphones.</Review>

     <Review>Pros: great sound quality

Cons: price was a little higher than stores I checked online

I was in Bestbuy on Black Friday looking for a new pair of headphones. I asked an employee who was modeling off a pair of studio beats how he liked them and if they were worth the cost. He said they were alright and showed me this pair of Sony&apos;s. These headphones are great, I am so glad i picked these up. They are comfortable, durable, and they sound great. I would highly recommend this pair of headphones for anyone looking for a new pair.</Review>

     <Review>these headphones are really good if you like the bass of course. they are very strong and you can feel the bass pumping inside you. i&apos;d recommend these; they are good fit, comfortable, cushions are extremely soft as well. only problem is that it leaks sound... so when it&apos;s really quiet and there are people around you, they can hear your music. i think that it&apos;s bad when that happens, unless you&apos;re fine with people listening. Also when you turn up your volume to the max, the bass starts to take over the vocals; you&apos;ll still hear them but there will be more bass.</Review>

I have been looking for a phenomenal pair of headphones for a very long time. I went to the best buy store and tried these ones out and I was just blow away by how great the sound quality was. Everything about these headphones is what I have been looking for and even more. I had tried on other headphones at the store but I was not really happy with them. I feel that these headphones are even better than the Dr. Dre Beats. And they are also at a reasonable price. I am completely satisfied :) bravo!</Review>

     <Review>these headphones are extremely comfortable and sound great. bass hits hard, so be sure you really want a lot of bass. they do leak a lot of sound. way too much for me to use these in the office or sitting around any quiet places. just be aware of this before buying if you care about leakage disturbing others.</Review>

     <Review>Pros: They are very simple to use, Affordable, have great bass sounds, and have good sound quality. Seems to noise cancel.

Cons: They are not collapsible, and they could have had more cushioning on the head rest, but that is self fixable.

These were the first headphones that I tested when I walked into Best Buy. As soon as I tested them,I was hooked. They give out great sound quality and alot of bass, but the bass is not too overpowering. The headphones seem very comparable to the more expensive noise cancelling headphones. With the music off, you can here noise, but with the music on you can barely hear any noises. I would recommend these to anyone who wants allitle more bass sound with the music and quality still sounding brilliant.</Review>

     <Review>Pros: Crisp clear sound, and just about everything

Cons: not as much bass as I expected

I didn&apos;t actually buy these headphones, but they were my second choice. I tested them out in Best Buy and they were awesome. They felt very durable and were comfortable. I was impressed by the clear crisp sound quality. However, for an &quot;Extra Bass&quot; pair of headphones I was disappointed. Almost all of the sample songs were hip hop songs and the bass was there, just not very powerful. I even tested the Bose Around-Ear headphones for $140 which had a much fuller and powerful bass, but not overpowering for those who don&apos;t want thumping bass.

For the average music listener, if you like listening to music with high rich quality and a little more bass, get these. I&apos;d recommend these to alm ... ost everyone. You&apos;ll get much more than you&apos;re paying for! However, if you&apos;re looking for bass or love booming bass like I do (I have subs in my car) I wouldn&apos;t get these; I&apos;d go with the Skullcandy Skullcrusher DJ Headphones with Subwoofers for just about the same price.

Hello,
Refrain from buying Dr Beats headphones and instead give these a try
Frankly speaking I was bit skeptical about buying these considering the price being too low to believe ($50 at B&amp;H).Nevertheless , upon my friend&apos;s advice, I got them and I am glad I did so.
The sound is well balanced for any genre and bass handling capacity is exceptional.Though to actually realise its full potential, you need to pump up the volume of your player.I usually keep my vol levels at 90% .
Even at high volumes, I hear no distorted image of the sound and the sound has a wide spectrum which makes you hear each element of the audio track distinctly.
All I can say its a great piece of audio engineering by Sony and am sure you ... will not regret your purchase.

     <Review>i use these for everything, but i watch you tube videos. the sound is rich, not tinny or irritating like some can be. the pads hug the ears to keep outside sounds from distracting you. there is one small complaint but not to take it away from a 5 star rating. that&apos;s the wide headband on top. it&apos;s padded but it&apos;s still just a big hard. maybe if they had narrowed it down a bit; it&apos;s so wide. like i said, not much of a complaint. they do fit snug and you don&apos;t get the outside sound distractions so you dont have to turn your videos up so loud. things sound great with these. i&apos;ll have them for a long long time.</Review>

     <Review>Pros: Great overall sound, extremely comfortable, and a good price!

Cons: The Cord is a bit short

I like most have had problems with headphones that cost 10-30 dollars because they end up going bad before 6 months and can be very uncomfortable and pricey after awhile. So yesterday I was researching for a new pair. As you can see this has very good reviews so I went to the store to give them a shot. You will notice the quality immediately by just putting them on. Your ears feel as if they are on pillows. Extremely comfortable. The sound is what was truly going to sell me. And it is truly has some of the best sounds for headphones I may have ever heard (Dr.Dre were the best and I had just tried those out prior to these). But what seems logical to you? Paying $250-$300 for Dr.Dr ... e or $80.00 for these which are extremely close in quality and still a great brand name (Sony). If you are picky about your headphones like I am then these are a great choice for you. My friends who have tried out my pair have loved them and wish they had it. As I said earlier this does have a rather short cord but its not a make or break point on buying them. I mean if you require having a cord where you need to use a rubber band to tie your cord then these are not for you. But they rarely present a problem in regards to the cord so I am perfectly fine with it. What others have wrote for their reviews is pretty much on dot. I saw one guy mentioned his ears were sweaty after about 3 hours of use because of these head phones ( have yet to go 3 hours at once) but I am only assuming the sweat is caused by the headphones getting him/her into the song intensely. Oh and the Bass. Lets just say it wont disappoint you ;). But what is best is that its &quot;not&quot; just Bass. The voices are very clear and mend well with the bass. One of my best investments for music.

These are really comfortable earphones. They also sound very good. As advertised, they have a lot of bass. It was just too much for me. But bassheads should look here first.</Review>

     <Review>Pros: Light headphons,GREAT BASS, clear, and get go VERY LOUD.

Cons: After long periods of time (hours) gets sweaty.

I first purchased the Skullcrusher DJ Headphones. I like them cause of the &quot;rumble bass&quot; thing they have, but the sound,sound low and muffed. So i took them back and got these babies and WHOA!. I love these headphones. They are light,clear,very good bass, and u don&apos;t look like a fool walking around wearing them lol.

I honestly think these headphones were a STEAL for the price because, they sound like 200-300 headphones. The only downside is that, i listened to music for like 3 hours straight and i took them off and it was alittle sweaty and the cord is a little shorter than i like. But i guess that expected. Love these heads phones for my zune HD!.</Review>

     <Review>Pros: The sound and comfort

Cons: short cord

These are great headphones that not only deliver great bass, but the overall listening experience is great. I searched the web and went to all the stores and tried them all on and these are by far the best for the money. These blow the $125 flimsy Bose Tri ports out. There is no comparing them to any in the price range. You have to get into the $300 plus range to even come close. These are not noise canceling but you&apos;ll never know it when you play your music, although the people close to you can hear it a little if your blasting it out. These baby&apos;s rock, you&apos;ll think the whole house is rumbling when you crank it up from a decent source. I suggest trying these yourself as people do have varied taste when it comes to headphones, but ... for me, these are by far the best in this price range.

     <Review>Pros: Comfortable and good ambience

Cons: Not enough mids and highs. Love the drivers though.

I am a professional mucian and was searching for a pair of gutsy phones that would give the feel of being on stage experiencing a big bass sound without having to take out a loan The Sony Extra Bass phones are gutsy, however, for the avid listener who wants to hear the difference between Zylgin and Paiste cymbals, etc., highs and mids in other instruments, they are too heavy on the low end. Even after adjusting EQ settings in mixers and such. By all means try them for yourself. Sony has my YEP on these phones, they are just not for me as I am an arranger.</Review>

     <Review>Pros: Sound/Comfort.

Cons: They could be a little more durable, but they do their job.

Just got these a couple of days ago, i am really picky when it comes to headphones. Its taken me alot of returning to finally find some that i can actually enjoy putting on and relax too. These give you a good thump when you need it. I was really surprised on the sound quality of these considering the price, but they work just as good as beats. The durability i was worried about but as long as you take care of them you&apos;ll be fine. Great Product, Sony did a real good job with these.</Review>

     <Review>Pros: ~very Comfrotable King Sized Cushions

Cons: ~may Be Very Unhandy To Carry Around Due To Size

These are beast headphones and beat the BEATS by comfort and bass. What i have to say is that the cushions are really i mean really comfortable also the you get a nice thump out of the headphones due to XtraBass put don&apos;t worry if you like listening to classical &amp; jazz music you can always turn up the tremble on the equaliser. These are amazing for watching movies the suround sounds are better than most surround sound systems no joke. Plus they look quite cool if you carry them around your neck also the flat wire looks really stylish and trust me you won&apos;t get let down by these. So bassically these are all rounders you can use them for home cinema, music, gaming and for elec ... trical instruments. So just get them what are you waiting for.

     <Review>I have owned these headphones for 5 months now and I still cannot put them down. I did a lot of research before I bought these headphones. I was looking for deep luscious sounds so bass was a top priority for me, and if you like Bass, then look no further. The bass is very good- it strikes a good balance such that it is not overwhelming and the giant cushions just augment the overall experience. I am in college so I use these headphones practically everywhere, with my phone, ipod, watching movies on my laptop(great for sound effects!) I was a little worried about their size and wearing them around because of the giant cushions, but after wearing them outside once, I kept getting complimented on them, so you shouldn&apos;t worry about that. Also, they are surprisingly lightweight and the build i ... s sturdy. I did a quick comparison with Dr Dre Beats, and the bass on the MDR-XB500s is way better, so if you are looking for bass, look no further. The only thing I can think about as a draw back are the cords sticking out from each ear; would have been better if it was just one but definitely not a dealbreaker.

     <Review>Pros: Price, quality

Cons: Can&apos;t think of a darn thing wrong with &apos;em

I&apos;ve tried them all: in ear, over ear, on ear, under ear, top of ear, left of ear, no ear, etc :)

These are by far and away the best out there for its price. Sure if you wanna go really high end and spend more on a pair of headphones than on the phone you plug it into, then the bose is up there with this one. but honestly, i dont think you need all that noise cancelling mumbo jumbo. I commute on bus and subway every day and these headphones cancel out noise just fine. i watch movies on my commute and these headphones allow me to hear everything, and i even dont have the volume turned up all the way! and the best part, dont have to use batteries, turn on noise cancelling, etc. just ridiculous, imo. ... &gt;
get these headphones. i am as picky as a human being can get about this type of stuff, and i can say with close to certainty, you will feel better about yourself when you realize you paid half the price of a bose set but get the quality sound that you were looking for.

     <Review>Pros: Everything. Comfortable and bass is perfect and the highs and mids are incrediably clear!

Cons: nothing now that i think about it...

i bought these at the store, and i put them on in the store and it sounded nothing special but i was thinkin &quot;well it is sony and they&apos;re a good brand and everything.&quot; so i bought them and took them out to my car to listen to them and they sounded absolutely incrediable!!! You cant feel them on your head what so ever. The music is clear and the bass is powerful and gets real low. It really is the best 80 dollars ive spent. I took them on a bball trip down to cincinnati last weekend and all my teammates say that they&apos;re gonna get a pair of these exact ones before the season starts. Best headphones ive listened too. they really are. they can ... cell out everything when the music IS ON just to let u all know.

     <Review>Pros: Amazing Bass, sound quality, and Comfort

Cons: nothing so far

I put them on and during the first notes of the first song I played I fell in love! They are AMAZING. The sound quality is incredible. I&apos;m almost rediscovering my music because I&apos;m hearing sounds that I previously never heard. I had originally bought the Sony Sound Canceling headphones and found the sound quality to be a little above average and they were very uncomfortable after a few hours. (I listen to music as I write. I&apos;m on my computer all day) But the quality and comfort of the Sony Extra Bass is amazing. The bass is everything I was hoping for, yet not over the top like the Skull Crushers. I hooked my new Sony&apos;s up to my iPod and cranked the volume and the headphones where almost loud enough to work a ... s normal speakers. So if you wanna wear them around your neck and listen this is quite possible. I&apos;m curious to see how well they block outside noise...

In short, I was so impressed that I took the time to actually write a review. And I never do that.

     <Review>Pros: Good bass, inexpensive

Cons: Padding gets a little hot

This is a great set of headphones if you like booming bass. The ear pads are comfortable but if your head gets a little hot like mine, you may only use it for 15-20 minutes at a time. Although these headphones sound great, I would definitely look at others if you are looking for balance in sound quality. Overall, these are good headphones for under $100.</Review>

     <Review>Pros: Bass Doesn&apos;t Outweigh Treble,Cheap!,Very Loud,Very Responsive Bass

Cons: Painful Ear Aches If Worn For More Than 3 Hours.,Slight Sound Leakage

Awesome headphones. I&apos;ve had 5 different sony headphones before, and these by far are the best in every way. Very cheap for such high quality; the bass is extraordinary, but not just very high, its very rational to the treble. For $80, these are a definite steal. Highly recommended.</Review>

These are really great headphones with amazing sound. The large cushions make the headphones comfortable and blocks out most other sounds.
They have great quality, for a very reasonable price - other headphones with the same features cost at least double the price!</Review>

     <Review>Pros: Amazing Sound Quality,Excellent Bass,Great Comfort

Cons: Sound Leakage

I recently purchased these headphones and I can honestly say they&apos;re spectacular! I can literally listen for hours and forget they&apos;re on my head. The bass sticks out and rolls on immaculately, yet doesn&apos;t over-power the music. One flaw to a handful of people is the amount of sound the headphones leak. To enjoy these thoroughly a volume must be pumped up, yet they do give a lot of sound. I myself don&apos;t mind but to others it is rather annoying. Other than that the headphones are perfect! definitely worth the cash/</Review>

     <Review>Pros: Price, Bass, Sound Quality

Cons: non removable cord

i bought these headphones on a budget, usually buying 20-30 dollar headphones, these were more expensive than the headphones i usually buy but totally worth the money. From listening to Bose and Dr. Dre headphones, i see little to no difference in these. Spending only 80 dollars is a steal. I was debating whether to get these or the noise canceling headphones, but these big pads really isolate outside noise. The bass is deep and loud, highly recommended buy!</Review>

     <Review>Basically I had been looking for an awesome pair of over the ear headphones and I had my eye on some other two pairs, but had been debating whether or not I should grab them. I then came across these on Sony&apos;s website and was sold. I bought them the next day and I have no regrets. They are comfortable to wear for long periods of time, the bass sounds great, not too overbearing, and the mids and highs come in really well also. If you&apos;re looking for headphones and they aren&apos;t these, simply change your mind to getting these and you&apos;ll be fine.</Review>

     <Review>Pros: quality of BASS

Cons: causes ears to sweat

These are the most powerful headphones that I&apos;ve ever heard. The quality of BASS is amazing. These headphones are huge and comfortable but I cant wear these more than a few hours without getting a headache even on low volume. Im overall satisfied with my purchase.</Review>

     <Review>I just bought a MDR-XB500&apos;s @ the Sony Store near my house and I LOVE them. They are very comfortable and the sound &amp; bass is, in my opinion the best you will get for its price. They are definetly a must buy if you listen to music as much as I do. One more thing, there is a weird kinda Princess Leia thing going on. Its probobly just me.</Review>
