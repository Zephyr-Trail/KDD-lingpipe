     <Review>I have had my tablet for over a year now and it is still going strong with no problems at all. I knew I didn&apos;t want an Ipad because I wanted to be able to use droid apps. I compared samsung, asus, and a few other brands. Acer gave me more of what I wanted for a lower price. I have the 16GB that has a micro SD card slot and USB slot. I have taken it on business trips and vacations. As far as an e-reader it works great. I like the size even though it can get a little heavy after holding for a long period of time. I bought a cover that has a stand so works out. I love my tablet and am glad I picked Acer!

Battery Life

The battery life is good for normal activities. If you download some apps that won&apos;t let the system shut down automatically when not in use then that can ... drain the battery quickly.

Processing Speed

Not much on wait time for things to run. I like the speed.

App Availability

It runs on driod apps which I love. I can find almost anything. I can read books through my barnes and noble app.

Design

Easy to get to things you want.

     <Review>Pros: Performance, Connectivity and Price

Cons: Weight

I got mine last november and I just love this tablet.. Even being a refurb item it´s just like a new one, no scratches, no damages, LCD screen seems to be100% new ..and the battery lasts between 6 and 7 hours... summarizing, I have no complaints about the item, For 299 USD it´s a very good deal &quot;&quot;... The only bad thing is that it didn´t come with the owner´s guide but android is so easy to use that there&apos;s no need for a guide.</Review>

     <Review>I&apos;ve had this thing for 6 months so I&apos;m not writing a review the day after I get it and automatically giving it a 5 star review just because of how it is to me. Also I am very well versed on the Android OS and I have 3 separate android devices. With that being said...

I really do enjoy the Acer Iconia. It has a very sharp display and looks great with HD videos and every day usage. Battery life is more than enough for me and I usually charge it once every 3 days or so with medium, but not constant usage. Its rated at 10 hours of video playback but anyone who has 10 hours to do nothing but watch videos on a tablet might have more problems than shopping for a tablet. I like having the full size usb port, although i dont use it much, it is nice to have. If you&apos;re into rooting, like I am ... , it is very easy to do with this tablet. It is a little heavier than other tablets but it also has an aluminum body and feels very solid. The other thing is that this tablet has some of the better speakers for a tablet. Overall this is a great tablet. I would wait, however for the price to drop a bit because of the fact that quad core processors are right around the corner. $299 is a good price point and if it ever hits that then it is a steal.

     <Review>Pros: Price to performamce, battery life, screen

Cons: File transfers are clunky

This is a very good tablet with great display and wonderful battery time. I love the full size USB port that can power a remote drive easily. The only down side is the inability to plug into my PC and transfer files to the SD card. You have to remove the SD card and plug it into the PC to transfer files - a bit of a bother, but not insurmountable. The feel is good and I have no problem keeping all the buttons out of the way. Good sound, but ear buds are better. I have lots of apps and pictures and don&apos;t even have 1/2 the main memory full. Skype works well too.</Review>

     <Review>I would highly recommend this product! One of the best features is the benefit of the USB port, which makes it extremely easy to add music files, mp3&apos;s, and any personal files from a standard desktop or laptop computer.

Battery Life

Very important, because if I am traveling or on the go, I like it to hold a charge for as long as possible.

Processing Speed

It is very important as well, I am pleasantly surprised at the fast speed of this great tablet.

Weight

As this is my first tablet, I am told by I-Pad owners that my Acer Iconia is &quot;too heavy.&quot; I think it&apos;s perfect, just heavy enough, and is easy to carry in a bag or a case.

App Availability

I really like the choices of both paid and free aps on this tablet.

Design

It is ... very important, very well designed, and lightweight enough to carry aropund.

Durability

I love that my Acer Iconia is very flexible, strong, and easy to carry.

Cons: not really anything i can think of

Great Tablet I have owned it for about a month, looking into getting an iPad 2 but going to bestbuy and trying the tab out i preffered it over the iPad and I am very glad a chose this tablet. All of the people saying all the apps force closes are wrong I have only ran into 2 apps that have had me force a close which was no big deal. Netflix isn&apos;t out on it yet but there is no doubt it soon will be. Whats also better on the acer then the iPad is that it runs flash.
Awesome graphics runs smooth, battery life is awesome and the screen is very bright and clear and connects to the internet very good. Great accerories to buy for it to. Very Good price $399 with a $100 best buy gift card.
All in all a perfect replacemen ... t for your laptop or netbook.

     <Review>Pros: functionality, outstanding price, Android OS

Cons: Not a thing.

I&apos;ve had my A500 for about a month now and absolutely love it. Every single person that sees me with it says &quot;oooohhhh...is that an iPad?&quot; I proudly tell them No. I love the functionality of the A500. A lot of &quot;professional&quot; reviews complained about the weight. I don&apos;t even notice the weight. It&apos;s no big deal. It&apos;s sleak, slim, and has unbelievable clarity. Other reviews didn&apos;t like the WiFi antenna range, but I&apos;ve had no problems with that. In fact, I can get further away from my hotspot with the A500 than I can with my iPod Touch. This thing rocks. You can&apos;t beat the price vs. the iPad, and it can do everything that toy can do, if not more (i.e. Flash, external storage, etc). If you&apos;re on the fence, buy i ... t. It&apos;s worth it.

     <Review>Pros: easy to use, fast, android marketplace is great, compact

Cons: speakers on back are kind of hard to hear

I bought this for my 14 year old son and I was afraid he might not like it. Boy was I wrong. This has been the best thing I could have bought him. I bought my daughter and iPad 64 gb on the same day I bought this for my son, so we have been comparing them a lot. This is almost as good as an ipad and in some instances, even better. I help my son with his math homework a lot and we use his Acer Tablet every night, looking up formulas on the internet, using the calculator app on it, etc. The marketplace is just as full of great apps as the apple apps. I used this tablet one night to trouble shoot a friends wireless router even. It&apos;s the perfect size ( I don&apos;t care about ... super thin just to say it&apos;s super thin) and the screen is really clear. The battery life is perfectly fine. It&apos;s fast and I&apos;ve heard that we&apos;ll be able to upgrade to ice-cream-&apos;sammich&apos; very soon! If you&apos;re needing a good tablet and are worried about this one, don&apos;t be. Buy it! I don&apos;t normally take the time to even do reviews, but this time I had to tell the good news about this tab. The only down at all is that the speakers are kind of hard to hear because of their placement in back, but it&apos;s not &apos;that&apos; big of a deal to me.

     <Review>I purchased this due to wanting an android tablet (already have an IOS device). I found the product easy to set up (wireless and accounts were quite easy to establish). The device charges fast and has good battery life. The unit does feel heavy compared to ipad 2 but of course is much lighter than my notebook computers. Apps were easy to install and I was able to access my android and google accounts for downloading apps I already owned.
Sound system is good enough. Downside is that connecting to Bluetooth or wireless speakers is not an option (I should say that as of my purchase date there was only one option).
Skype works well for video chatting.
Music - It was more challenging using the apps (double twist and easy phone) to transfer music to the acer. I&apos;d used both before to lo ... ad music onto my android phone with ease.
SD card storage is limited to media storage and transfer. Apps can&apos;t be backed up.
I like the folder option to easily access app categories.
I decided to gift this tab to my mom, who loves it.
I didn&apos;t and wouldn&apos;t pay full price, I got it at a great sale price.

Easy to use, installed many apps from Market, no problems. Love the 3.0 Honeycomb OS. Battery life is very good. I travel often for pleasure, and the size/weight is perfect. Use this at home more than my PC.</Review>

     <Review>Pros: good price, large screen, easy to use, lots of apps

Cons: thickness

I bought 2 of these tablets for christmas, one for myself and one for my boyfriend. they are fantastic! i much prefer the andriod over the ipad anyday! the flexibility to download and do so much more for the lower price is well worth it! the cameras are great, and we are able to Skype using the forward facing camera which is one of the main reasons i bought this tablet. the battery life is great, and the screen is beautiful. the only thing you could possible complain about this tablet is the size, which isnt even that big, it is slightly thicker than most, but trust me you will not be disappointed with this product!</Review>

     <Review>Pros: USB Host Port; Battery Life; Easy To Customize; Screen; WiFi

The main gripe I have is the lack of reasonably prices sleeves, they all seem lacking and way overpriced. Acer one looks really really cheap IMHO about a 10 buck item and still fourty bucks? Targus seems better but at fifty, no-go, also still does not offer full side/drop protection I want, may pay 15-20 for that one max but only good as a kickstand really. I think holding these for a long time is cumbersome and really need an included kickstand/case, this is a problem for all tablets in general though, not just this.

Android marketplace is full of junk so you have to spend a lot of time looking for something decent. Also, I hate the Google lock-in for a lot of the features. Want an option for all my data ... are not belong to &quot;the cloud&quot; or at least allow me to encrypt it and own the key so when they get compromised I&apos;m not along for the ride. I still stick to my old Palm/Palm Desktop for personal info just for this reason.

Graphics, CPU performance, and games seem stellar compared to my cheap Android phone. The USB port as mentioned over and over again is the major plus side with this as well as the metal construction. As others also mention, the short power cord is weak, at least offer a brick with a pluggable binocular type cord so I can add some length here, the one included is a wall-wart and corc is about 6ft too short at least.

Cons: Kinda heavy but okay

Really enjoying this tablet. Was on sale at Staples for $$$ for a pre-Black Friday sale. Great deal. Can&apos;t beat it for the price. A little heavy but overall not that bad and easy to handle or use with a cover/stand combo.

All the ports are available without having to add some proprietary dongle or put it into a docking station or keyboard stand. &quot;Regular&quot; USB, micro-USB and mini-HDMI.

Has a physical rotation lock switch to keep it from rotating the screen for incidental tilts of the screen. No need to go into software to enable or disable it.</Review>

     <Review>Pros: Easy to use, Fast, Stable, Lots of Connectivity Options,USB 2.0 port!!, Price, Features,Ease of Use, Flexibility

Cons: Weight, MicroSD only

First of all I am not an &quot;i&quot; guy, but the prospect of a tablet has always intrigued me. After getting about 20 IPads shoved in my face, I was starting to lose faith that a tablet was good for more than playing angry birds and playing music while acting as a $500 electronic photoframe. I did a lot of research on these tablets and ended up going with this one. The reason behind it was the full size USB port which makes all the difference when you want to use a thumb drive to move data around. I was leary making my purchase because many reviews I have read suggest that the Andriod Honeycomb OS is not quite there yet and is plagued by f ... requent crashes etc. I&apos;m making this post to combat those accusations from the &quot;i&quot;guys. This tablet is honestly friking awesome. The screen looks fantastic, battery life is excellent, browsing is as smooth as a desktop. It is easy to use and after a few days I still keep finding little built in tricks that leave me impressed with how slick of a little OS 3.2 Honeycomb is. If you are a tech person like me, you want this tablet because of the flexability of the Android OS. If you are not a tech person You&apos;ll probably be happy with either tablet. This one is however $150 cheaper #thats what I paid anyways# and you dont have to spend $30 for the adapter for each thing you want to plug into it because the ports are alreay there and working. As another note, I was concearned about the availability of apps for these things from some of the reviews I read, but I have spent hours upon hours looking at all the available apps and haven&apos;t even made a dent in the pool that are available.
There are only two things specific to this model that makes it not perfect. Im giving it 5 stars on here but if I could rate it more precisely it would be a 4.7. My only complaints are that it is a little heavier than the others and you will notice this if you try to hold it up with one hand and use it with the other. My lap however cannot tell the difference. My seco ...

     <Review>Pros: Easy To Use; Powerful; Fast; Easy To Set Up

I purchased the Acer Iconia A500 from Staples on Black Friday. I opted to purchase this tablet over other better deals because I enjoy my Acer laptop. I mainly purchased this tablet because I love the Android (had Android phones for many years now) and was hoping that I could use my laptop less often. I do find myself resorting back to the laptop mainly because of the keyboard my laptop has versus the on-screen acer keyboard. As for gaming, it plays most Tegra Zone games fine with some lag at times, but nothing horrid. I have been having issues with the market place here and there when I install something, it never says it completes. I have to force close the market place and attempt the download again which is usually fine. I ... doubt it&apos;s an issue with the tablet and more with the market. All in all, the tablet is great. Love having the full size USB port. Reads my flash drives and works with my sony memory card reader just fine. Attempted using a Xbox 360 controller but I dont think the games I tried supported it, may work fine with emulators? Only thing I wish Acer didnt skimp on was the power adapter length. Seriously is only a few feet. I usually have to leave the tablet on the floor because the cord isnt long enough to leave comfortably on top of a burrow or bookshelf, or if you wanted to sit on the couch without having to sit next to the outlet. Again, all in all I would purchase this tablet again over most others I have seen. Hopefully I will not regret not waiting for Tegra 3 processors.

     <Review>Pros: Less expensive than ipod. Great screen. Good sound. Netflix works!

Cons: Can feel heavy with prolonged use. Browser isn&apos;t &quot;Chrome&quot;

Android based tablets are improving quickly, but still lack the polish and nice touches of the iPod and its IOs operating system. That said, this tablet can satisfy with its clear, bright screen, good sound and a convenient form factor. The unit feels substantial and solid. Battery life is good, but with all my portable devices, I tend to keep it plugged in whenever possible. That keeps the internal rechargable batteries happy and long-lived. The recent addition of Netflix support has made this a great device! Also, check out the daily &quot;free&quot; app available through Amazon to get a good idea what is available. This tablet has all the features ... you would want, including still/video cameras (front and back), a GPS and Wifi. No 3G or 4G on the lower cost models - Wifi works really well for me. It has HDMI out and both master and slave USB ports (see below).

To view its HD video on your TV, you&apos;ll need to buy a special mini-HD cable (not included), and it works great. Using the supplied micro-USB cable, you can connect to your PC to transfer files to and from the unit. Despite what other reviews say, you *can* use that USB cable to transfer to/from your PC and the external SD card if you have placed one in the device (I&apos;ve only tried this under Windows 7). In addition, a standard USB port lets you connect other storage devices (USB sticks, for example) holding media and files.

The browser is good, but sometimes web sites don&apos;t format correctly. It is not Google&apos;s &quot;Chrome&quot; browser, but hopefully Chrome will make it to this tablet soon. Try the free &quot;Dolphin&quot; browser. You can get most of the major iPod apps you would want, Angry Birds, Pandora, Stitcher, Skype, Netflix, etc.

You can get Acer branded protective overlays for the glass screen, and a case, and a docking station. There are also third-party glass protectors and cases and skins available for reasonable cost.

With Google&apos;s next major version of Android coming ( Ice Cream Sandwich ), hopefully Acer will see fit t ...

     <Review>The Iconia A500 tablet works very well. It starts up when turned of,f in seconds and quickly picks up WIFI access points. The Android Market works well, with many free choices. The A500 just got the 3.2 Android update. This made the Apps designed for phones to be enlarged to better fit the larger tablet screen, as well as helping with GPS connections. I have had no problems connecting and using a wired keyboard for longer emails or memos. The Iconia recognizes the keyboard instantly and the words flow onto the screen. Games work very well with the gyroscope and built in vibrations, this is especially evident when using the free labyrinth games. You swear you can feel the large metal balls hitting the side of the tablet as you go through the maze...

Battery Life

Batter ... y life is good, the reviews all say 7 to 8 hours. I average 6, maybe because I set the screen to full brightness all the time, I like how it looks and makes it easier to see by my middle aged eyes. 

Processing Speed

The tablet has a dual chip 1 gigahertz chip. The Iconia is quick to start up, quick to open apps, but takes a few seconds to open most web sites as well as loading Android Market.

Weight

The weight seems fine to me. I used to lug a 6 pound laptop around, so a 1.6 pound tablet feels light to me.

App Availability

There are loads of free apps in the Android market that comes with the Iconia. The Market is a little hard to navigate past the most popular apps, but you can search by key words such as &quot;tablet&quot;, &quot;free&quot; and/or &quot;Space Shooter&quot; that makes the task of finding new apps to try much easier. 

Design

The design is good, I like having access to the full USB port, so I understand the design had to build around that. The power on button is a little hidden, especially when using a case, but with practice it works fine. Lot of smudges on the screen though, keep the black wiping cloth that comes with the tablet handy!

Durability

I have had the Iconia A500 for a month, I have not had any structural problems or concerns. The unit seems very well made, no loose or flimsy parts....

     <Review>Pros: Price, USB port, great battery

Cons: Hard to use at first

I was pretty hesitant to buy Acer because they don&apos;t make great computers. However, the guys at Best Buy ensured me that this tablet was great for the money. After using it at the store for a while, I was sold. The main thing that got me was the USB port. As a student, I live and die by my zip drive and it&apos;s incredibly convenient. I have all my power points on my thumb drive and can open them with the tablet (if you want to view word, excel or PowerPoint documents, you have to get an app but it&apos;s free. I believe a different app let&apos;s you edit them). Another awesome feature is the microSD memory card slot which almost no other tablet on the market can offer (especially with a USB port). I bought this for school an ... d couldn&apos;t be happier. My brother owns an I pad and I honestly cannot believe that for the same price, I got my Acer Iconia AND the two year protection plan with Geek squad AND a $100 Best Buy gift card because it was a special offer for the tablet. I would highly recommend this to anyone who wants a tablet for anything, especially school. I am beyond impressed with the product and have converted a few people to consider the acer Iconia or at least a tablet with a USB...you never know when you might need to look at a document you have saved on a thumbdrive.

     <Review>Pros: Integrates well with MS Exchange, Hotmail, Gmail, great video &amp; sound! Great battery life.

Cons: Short charging cable. Limited aftermarket accessories.

This is the first time in twenty years I&apos;ve purchased a first generation technology product. I work in IT and my job involves large systems that I need to make work. Well, when I come home, I just want my tech to work - and cost effectivly at at that. The Acer Iconia A500 does that.

For example, no boot up time if I want to check my emails in the morning using the included email app (Great!).. The tablet sits on my nightstand and before I roll out of bed I grab the tablet, plug in my secret id, check my work and personal emails, check my work and personal calendar, set it down and know what&apos;s coming my way for ... the day. No heaviness, quick, and fabulous.

Also, having the normal-sized USB port is HUGE and a cost-saver. Sure, you can go bluetooth or buy some silly add-on dock that&apos;s also a keyboard and offers 2 USB ports for $150. Instead you can use a cheap wired or even wireless USB keyboard on this sucker. I&apos;m typing out this review with a $15 logitech K360 USB wireless keyboard right now and it&apos;s working flawlessly. Same goes for usng a USB wireless mouse. Finally, that USB also comes in handy moving files from my USB 8Gb Flash drive. Awesome! Tangled upconverted to 720p looks great!

And did I mention the sound? Two speakers with great separation and dolby enhanced sound make Tangled&apos;s Mandy Moor sound great considering the small footprint the drivers work with. In fact, these speakers can get quite loud and provide good separation.

I looked at the ASUS and from a cost and functionality perspective it&apos;s really not competitive if you only occassionally need a portable keyboard and full-size USB port. To get the same functionality as the A500 on the ASUS you need to buy the dock for $150 more. Instead, save yourself that amount, buy the A500, be green and re-use an old wired or wireless USB keyboard, and bet happy you made the right decision. Besides, since when is comparing an Acer Iconia Tablet against and ASUS Transformer with a $150 add-on accessor and apples ...

Cons: Very short power cable

Pros:
Inputs (MicroSD, HDMI, USB)
Android OS
Ease of Use
Price
Speed

Cons:
Very short power cable
Weight (just a little heavy)

This tablet is a great choice if you are looking for something that has great performance but not a $500 price tag. While this item is extremely easy to root and install custom ROMs, I have not found the need to do so yet. I am very pleased with it stock. Great selection of apps from the android marketplace as well as Amazon App Store.

There are two downsides. The power cable used to charge the device is extremely short. It is impractical to use this device while charging because you are stuck being nearly next to the wall outlet. The other downside i ... s the weight. It is a little heavier than other tablets, but it is not unbearable.

I primarily use this for business and have been quite pleased. I can edit/save all my Word, Excel, AND PDFs (apps available in market). It is also great for games when I have some free time. Games like &apos;Plants vs. Zombies&apos; and &apos;Angry Birds&apos; look fantastic on this tablet.

Overall considering the price and specs, this is a great buy. With the Tegra2 dual-core processor and 1gig of memory, this is a great choice for a variety of users. 16gigs of space is quite a lot, especially considering you can add a microSDHC card.

     <Review>Pros: price. speed. ease of use. usb port. other ports.

Cons: weight.

I&apos;m typing this on my tablet using the on screen keyboard and it works perfectly. Just be sure to elevate your fingers! I bought a keyboard case and waiting for it to arrive but that should be a good accessory for when I want to use it like a net book. Why pay an extra $150 for a keyboard dock for the Asus? Plus my keyboard has a buit-in case!

No problems with it so far after using it for a week.

Yes, as others have noticed, on white backgrounds, you can see the screen.like web touch screen spots BUT you forget about it and don&apos;t notice it when you&apos;re actually using it, so to me, it isn&apos;t an issue. But I think you&apos;d be able to view that on all tablets because of the type of screen they have. ... r&gt;
Once I downloaded a file manager, it was easy to view and access my flash drive through the AWESOME USB port! The main reason why I chose this tablet forget about adapters and docking stations, what a waste those are. How convenient is that having to lug around an adapter or docking station to gain access to a USB port?

The weight was a concern for me. I am a weakling! Haha. It DOES get tiring holding onto it in landscape mode, but I usually have it resting on a pilow or my stomach or my legs and I&apos;ve been fine with it. My husband says the weight is fine and doesn&apos;t bother him at all. Plus, I held other tablets and they all pretty much we heavy to me, so I don&apos;t think it matters a few extra ounces, especially since the USB and SD card slot and HDMI ports are there!

I don&apos;t like the docking port sticking out on the bottom. When holding it, it digs into hand BUT looking at other tablets, most have the docking station jutting out on the bottom. Would have been nice if it was a hidden covered port like the SD card port is.

Power charger is short, but I have my surge protector cable that I pulled out, and I can comfortably use the tablet on my couch while charging. And since everyone should be using a surge protector, then there is no problem with the length. Or you can buy an ...

     <Review>Pros: HDMI Out, SDCard, Full Sized USB Port

Cons: Front Facing Camera, Build Quality, Lack of optimized apps

So I purchased the Iconia for the sole reason that they did not have any iPad 2&apos;s in stock. I am not an Apple fan boy by any means. With that said, I think that the quality of the ipad is far better than the Iconia.

I am going to break this review down into a couple of sections.

Hardware: When I first opened the box I was excited to get it charged up so I could start playing with it. Then I found out how disappointed I was in the charger. The cord was really short, which means no browsing while it was being charged. And also the connector was the old style laptop plug. I was expecting it to be charged with the USB Connector.
As I looked over the exteri ... or of the tablet trying to become familiar with it I noticed how it did not feel as solid as the other tablets(Xoom, Ipad, Dell) This was kind of a turn off for me. The cover for the SDcard slot felt cheap as well. I could see a problem later on down the road with that cover breaking off.

The screen was Pretty nice I must say, I watched a couple of movies on it and they looked pretty good, I have only good things to say regarding the display.
I was very disgusted in the front facing camera, I thought that it would have been pretty decent seeing that it is advertised as 2.0MP, but it was very choppy and slow. I also did not like the fact that the camera was not centered on the tablet, it is offset to the right which made video chatting awkward.

Software: Well the first thing that I noticed was that there are only a handful of apps that are optimized for tablets. I know that later on down the road this issue will be addressed and developers will start making more apps that handle the screen resolution.

I installed a couple of apps that I use on my phone and most of them crashed consistently. It was very annoying. I also noticed in &quot;Settings&quot; that you can see what has been using up your battery. 33% of my battery was drained by cell standby. I was not happy, This is not a 3G Tab, so why is searching for cell coverage ...

     <Review>Pros: Easy To Set Up; Powerful; Easy To Use; Fast; Well balanced in my hands

Cons: None yet

This tablet might be a bit heavier than the others but it does not feel like it when I use it. Great screen, intuitive and easy to use. Very responsive touch screen and beautiful speakers. They may not be loud but they are very crisp and clear. I owned a Viewsonic G Tablet and hacked it like crazy. It runs honeycomb now but I could not pass this up. A great deal for the price. And I am not that easy to please :-)</Review>

     <Review>Pros: usb ports, dolby sound, battery

Cons: case, screen auto brightnes not working

Do not mind spelling, I am typing it on A500 Iconia.
First the most important features of this tablet are
1. This is the only tablet, which has Dolby and build in equalizer for audio and video mode. This makes sound perfect when connected to headsets or external audio, as well as internal speakers sound better. None of the other tablets have this, including: Zoom, Asus, Samsung galaxy 10.1.
2. It has 2 USB ports, where I was able to connect USB sticks and even my WD passport with 750 Gig. Was able to copy files from camera to externsl HD both connected to tablet. This is great feature.

These are the most important features.
What I do not like:
1. Screen brightness does no ... t adjust based on external elumination. So there is no sensor at all, or it does not work. If it is just software issue, I hope it will be fixed, if not I can leave with it because accessing brightness settings is much easier with Honeycomb.
2. Maximum brightness of the screen is not highest possible,and in bright sunlight screen washed out.
3. Not able to charge via USB port. Provided charger has short cord, but I will extend it by cutting it and add wires. But still requires to carry extra charger. I think it would be required for any tablet, because standard USB port power is not enough to charge any tablet in reasonable amount off time.
4. The only case available is ugly and it smells bad, like burned rubber. Too hard to pull tablet out of the case. Also icase is expensive where it should cost twice less.
5. Very rare force close in market, but not a deal braker.

What I like as well:
Most of regular android apps are working. Android scales these apps pretty well, so claims that there is only 30 apps available is false. You will be able to use most of the existing android apps.Downloaded tons of kids games and my five year old loves it.

Tethring via my dell streak 5 and it is working very good having internet connection anywhere. No reason for 3g model. WiFi is just perfect.

OsS is great hard ...

     <Review>Pros: Size, usability, speed, sound, availability of apps, price

Cons: Screen does have a glare which makes it difficult but not impossible to use in well lit rooms or outdoors.

I had gone into BestBuy this past weekend intending to pick up a 10&quot; netbook when I saw this sitting there for just a little more money than the netbook. I had looked at the IPad&apos;s previously and decided against them because of the lack of Flash compatibility and USB drives. This guy here had both, was $50 less than the IPad and I love the Acer Name so I decided to give her a try. I have to say I am not disapointed. It is slightly heavier than the IPad but who exactly intends to stand there holding the thing out in front of you for hours at a time. It has a lot of speed and the touch screen is very se ... nsative (almost to sensative). Although it only plays MP4&apos;s currently, it does play them flawlessly with awesome graphics. The sound is good and loud too which eliminated the need for external speakers unless I&apos;m in a noisy invironment in which case it does have a headphone port. It does take a bit using it to remember where all of the apps are located at as there are a lot of screens that can be accessed but if you want everything in one central location you can do that as well very easily. It offers 3 different ways to transfer your files on and off of it which is just wonderful. I took it into a couple of meetings with me the other day and it was awesome tohave all of my information at my fingertips. And the battery lasts a good long time with normal use. I would recomend this to anyone!!!

     <Review>Pros: fast, good display

Cons: short charger cord

Here are some observations I&apos;ve made over the past week...some may be Iconia specific and some may be Honeycomb specific.

1. I plugged some headphones in and the external speakers stayed on. I tried 2 sets of headphones and they both do it...that sorta stoopid!

2. The Hero of Sparta game is NOT the full version. It&apos;s a very short demo...it looks good and shows off the graphics capability of the unit ably but I was looking forward to some more monster bashing...The other two included games, Need For Speed and Let&apos;s Golf DO seem to be full versions and also look and play great.

3. The unit is generally very fast in all things. I have noticed some slowdown in wifi when switching from one router to another but ... a reset fixes it. The reset hole is super small...I wish it was just a smidge bigger.

4. I&apos;ve had to reset the unit several times, mostly to fix the above-mentioned wifi slowdown. I wonder if just turning off wifi and turning it back on might accomplish the same thing.

5. I&apos;ve tried 4 different browsers (stock, Dolphin, Firefox, Opera) and have pretty much settled on Dolphin HD. I&apos;m disappointed because I REALLY wanted to use Firefox but it just doesn&apos;t seem to be up to snuff. Rendering on some fonts and graphics just doesn&apos;t seem to be as crisp as all three other browsers. I also don&apos;t like how it handles tabs. Dolphin seems more like a proper browser and supports various plugins with mixed success. AdBlock doesn&apos;t seem to work at all and Xmarks works OK but doesn&apos;t seem to be able to import bookmarks that are in subfolders with 100% success.

6. The wireless card is just OK. With a strong signal it&apos;s great but at my desk at work I&apos;m pretty far from the router and, while my laptop gets 1 to 2 bars (and sporadically disconnects, but not unusably so), the Iconia gets a maximum of 1 bar and is disconnected more often than not.

7. Multitouch is very nice and responsive...the interface in general is very snappy and I don&apos;t ever feel like I&apos;m waiting on it excess ...

     <Review>Pros: Price. Apps. Display. Functionality. Connectivity.

Cons: Nothing yet.

Superb display; snappy performance; and quite a number of Tablet specific apps. Desire one was to have a platform for all my technical documentation -- so far it&apos;s met my needs for PDF and CHM documents. The number of apps that actually enhance productivity is substantial. The use of dropbox or filesanywhere lets me deal with pretty much an document or other media-type access. My phone is a hotspot so in pinch I&apos;ve got connectivity on Verizon anywhere... and with the wealth of WIFI spots all over, I seldom need the phone. Very happy with the device. Recommend getting a capacitive stylus -- for some things is much better and quicker than touch. The weight is really !!! no issue.</Review>

     <Review>Pros: Tons of Features,and good price

Cons: Not a whole lot of accessories for it yet.

After reading reviews on just about every tablet out there and playing around with them in stores. I decided on this one. I must say I am very pleased with everything. Its easy to use,runs smooth,has great battery life,beautiful screen, and expandable memory(I added an 8GB Micro SD). Found my wi-fi in my home immediately after I turned it on. For the money you cant go wrong. I have been recomending it to everyone I know.</Review>

     <Review>Pros: Bright Screen, 9Hrs Battery Life, Best VALUE.

Cons: weight.

I recently switch from iPhone to Android world... and I have to say it has been a pleasant experience. I love the options of different devices and the interface of Android has been fast, easy and meets my needs;

That said, I was skeptical about Android Tablets given limited applications on the marketplace, however there is NO doubt in mind that it will evolve very very fast just like the smartphones did; Not to mention Android tablets BEATS HANDS DOWN iPad 2 on features ( except weight :) which I don&apos;t care as much...

Motorola is just too expensive and not mention it has sharp edges.. which makes it hard to hold for long period of time.. Keep this in mind as Acer is actually pretty easy and comfor ... table to hold.

I also looked as Asus.. which just feels CHEAP with the plastics.... and all the ports are on the DOCK.. which I don&apos;t intent to carry. That&apos;s why I have my notebook ( HP 14.1&apos; DV Series) Dock is too expensive and a way to pay us more! Make sure to get a tablet with built-in ports.. trust me it will a long way;

I been reading all the reviews from publishers in Iconia and decided to purchase on Monday... I have to say, I see myself holding on to the tablets throughout the evening.. ( maybe honeymoon period) but, it is definitely more natural to update my facebook or send a quick mail while I am watching basketball ... great thing about this tablet is not ONLY the stylish design ( very nice metallic look and feel) but, also the bright screen and great battery life; I been on and off YOUTUBE, Facebook, playing Lets Golf etc, and it has been great to get 8~9 hrs of battery life;

Acer did a good job in making sure a FULL SIZE USB PORT ( bad for Apple), and SD card for expansion.

Also, they have some nice applications like Social Jogger which helps my keep update my social networking accounts.

I do want to buy a case, but Best Buy said they will get more Acer cases in few weeks.

OVerall, very happy with Acer and love the features of HoneyComb.

     <Review>Pros: NVidia Tegra 2, Touch response, Good battery life, Dolby sound, HDMI, Aluminum back, Android 3.0, Cheap.

Cons: A bit heavy other then that nothing.

First I want to let you people know that this isn&apos;t my first tablet or android device. I owned many and I mean many tablets. eLocity A7, Galaxy Tab, Dell Streak 5 (can&apos;t really call it a tablet), Dell Streak 7, Huawei tablet. None of them gave me what I was really looking for. Huawei and eLocity being to me the worst and the Dell Streak 7 being the worst in Battery life. I also have an iPhone 3Gs so I have experience with iOS as well.

Acer Iconia Tablet so far superiour to any of the devices I&apos;ve used so far. Android market is great as normal and it feels so nice in the hand with the Aluminum on the back...it actually ... feels like you get what you paid for. one thing not to many people in the Reviews say is that the Sound on this thing is very good for that it is; I really enjoy the speakers they put into it. The Tablet is a bit heavy but I really don&apos;t notice it too much, only when I lay on the sofa and kick my feet up to read Comics/Mangas but I didn&apos;t buy this just for Books. and nor should you IMO if you want a eReader just get a Nook.

Its super fast!! I will not lie it is very responsive. one thing I hated about the eLocity A7 is that when you Hook it up though HDMI the processor SLOWS way down as if it can&apos;t handle Mirroring. Not this thing its simply amazing HDMI works just as you would want it to work. no slow down at all for me when I play old school Emulation games or any other game. NVidia Tegra 2 can handle it trust me.

I was debating at first to get the Iconia or Transformer. besides this not having some peripherals you might want (keyboard dock) this thing is still very good. The price point is way better then Xoom but $50 more then the transformer. both are good tablets it just all depends if you think you need a Keyboard/Extra battery life (at the cost of $150 more for the Dock) get the Transformer but if your just looking for an all around good tablet that&apos;s solid get the Iconia. Oh and by all means the Iconia has good Battery life 8-9 hours, I jus ...

     <Review>Pros: price

Cons: flash size/power cord length

This has to be the shortest power cord that I ever seen. Acer, was it really that important for you to save that 3 cents by shipping a short power cord? The cost to your rep is probably greater than the money you saved. Internal flash is only 16 GB where most of the competition ships with 32 GB, again in the volume that Acer ships they could have done it right for a couple bucks more.

Otherwise, the tablet runs well, feels solid and the price is good. I am getting accustomed to the UI interface so I won&apos;t comment on it however initially I wasn&apos;t crazy about it. If enough people complain it will change with the next OS update so I will let that go.</Review>

     <Review>Pros: android 4.0 , full size usb 2.0 and micro sd card slot. micro hdmi out. front and rear camera.

Cons: its not quad core, not tegra 3

So a week ago I got an Acer A500 cuz I heard it was getting the 4.0 upgrade and so far its exceeded all my expectations. Right out of the box it was actually quite fast and responsive but I quickly upgraded it to 3.2 and it was much smoother. I did have difficulty getting the ICS update but a quick search on YouTube led me to an official Acer video tutorial on how to upgrade your A500 to ICS. It was super easy, all was done wireless, and it runs great. Websites load even faster than my laptop(which is still running xp). All games and apps I&apos;ve tried run great so far. This is a great deal for a great tablet. I really have no complaints. The ... screen looks great to me. I can easily expand the memory with a micro sd card and I can watch movies from my USB drive. The HDMI out is nice too. I really can&apos;t seem to put this thing down cuz its so entertaining. And yes I typed this review from the A500. Best bang for the buck by far!!

     <Review>Pros: Easy To Set Up; Fast; Easy To Use

I was looking for a tablet that I could use for reading my e-books, playing games, and checking email and facebook. The ACER does all of this with fabulous graphics, and the easy to use Android operating system... and so much more. I love reading on the ACER, even better than my Kindle- easier to adjust the font, and brightness of the pages.</Review>

     <Review>Really haven&apos;t used it to its full potential yet, but love it so far. It has great clarity, really not too difficult to learn, with a little help. Could have more instruction without having to read the manual every time (BTW - manual must be downloaded from web.)Takes a relatively long tim e to boot, but the battery life is so long, just put it to sleep when done, and it comes back up fast.</Review>

     <Review>Pros: Web Browsing; WiFi; Netflix Worked Well; Good Screen

Cons: Android OS major issues; Acer support sucks; Bricked during OS update

Used it for a couple of hours and it was great. Web browsing was fast, watched some of a Netflix movie and video was smooth. Unit is nicely made and even though this was a refurb came in like new condition. The problem came when I installed the required updates. First OS update went fine second OS update unit completely locked up. Absolutely no way to get the tablet to function again without sending it back to the manufacturer! I am very tech savvy and tried every possible way to roll back / reinstall the OS via SD card etc. Read all the online forums on how to fix this type of issue all to no avail. Tablets are not like PCs where you c ... an just reinstall the OS if something goes badly wrong. With this in mind it is essential to buy from a company that supports it&apos;s products and Acer IS NOT that company. Something like a $100 to get any kind of tech support - what a joke. Or send the unit back to Acer for repair! My advice go iPad or go home. At least if an iPad goes wrong there should be an [@] reasonably close that can deal with such an issue. Otherwise you may end up with a very expensive paperweight. For the [$] I paid I would say this tablet is reasonable value (if it worked) however you would be totally mad to pay the [$] retail price when Acer has literally no customer service. I shipped my unit straight back to Beach Camera for a full refund - bravo Beach Camera awesome no hassle customer service.

     <Review>Only used my wife&apos;s iPad2 three times, when I tried the Acer A500. Good price, GREAT service at B&amp;H! Processor response, OS and apps are very good. However, I was disappointed with the smudge-prone screen (Corning Gorilla Glass screens are better). Using a stylus would be a nice work-around, but I didn&apos;t have one at the time. The power input connector doesn&apos;t snap in and could easily slide out if you&apos;re not careful (like me). The shiny back was slippery, so I worried about dropping it. Here&apos;s the kicker. I only used it briefly while it was plugged in and, I thought, charging. It took all night to fully charged the battery, perhaps indicating a problem with the charging system. When the battery finally charged to 100% capacity, the unit would not turn on in battery mode. I returned it, ... paid a little more $ and bought a Lenovo Thinkpad Tab.

     <Review>In android tablets these were the best value we could find in 2011. Quality display and plenty of speed and battery life to meet our needs. We deployed about a dozen to key people and outside sales staff. They used them to enter information into company resources, stay in contact (video and e-mail) and present to customers. They are not the lightest or thinest out there but they are also not too heavy. Our people like the heft and prefer it over that i device. I have not had a single complaint about that. They are just as fast as any of the other tablest I tried and the price was the best I could find with a great build quality. In IT we use them for Remote Desktop sessions and such in a pinch. While they are not ideal devices they can get you by. The biggest issue we had was understa ... nding the devices and how to leverage them. People need to understand there is a difference between Tablets and Notebook Computer. You are not going to create a spectacular in depth excel spreadsheet on them. You can write a novel, but I am not sure I would want to - even with a keyboard.

     <Review>best value at this price. i use it as well at home - just easier when lying on the couch to quickly grab the tablet then the laptop - as for work. as working in many different places as a production manager it&apos;s way more comfy to bring the tablet than the laptop. everyone is surprised then that it works just as well as a normal computer. so for all the standard things you do at home / at work / on the road such as web browsing, checking mail, play some stupid games...etc. this tablet is just awesome. no freezes, no crashes, battery life (normal use: playing around for an hour then some hours stand-by) about ten hours - at least. when on stand-by overnight it just uses about 5% of the battery. have it now for 2 weeks, used it every day, absolutely no complaints. for sure it helps when you ... know android and of course be sure to fully load the battery before first use.

     <Review>Pros: Its size, resolution, and the USB, micro-HDMI outlets

Cons: Its microphone, face-facing camera.

I&apos;d considered iPad and Sumsung Galaxy before deciding on this Acer A500. Having had it for about a month now, I&apos;m generally happy with it. One glitch is that its 2.0 USB outlet, which was the major selling point for me, doesn&apos;t recognize all USB flash drives, nor does it read all portable hard drives either. Well, I will just have to use the flash drives that it &quot;likes&quot;. I can also confirm other reviews about its poor-quality microphone and its blurry face-facing camera. Otherwise, everything else seems fine.</Review>

     <Review>Pros: Ease of use

Cons: Size

I was not interested in a tablet until I won the Kindle Fire at our company Christmas party in Dec. From all reports the Kindle was a great reader, but since we already had the Nook, I decided to take back to Best Buy. Prior to returning, I looked at what I could purchase with the credit of the Kindle. I did some research and compared the Acer a500 vs the Asus Transformer. Both tablets recieved very good reviews with the nod going to the Transformer. However, the nod was based on purchasing the keyboard for an additional $149.00 that provides extra memory and extra battery life. I had no interest in the keyboard and thought I would give the A500 a try. Well, when I returned the Kindle, they had no A500&apos;s in stock and they did not expect to recieve ... get anymore any time soon. However, the sales girl had told me that they had one that was returned. I asked why and she said most tablets were being returned since they recieved them as gifts and they were brought back to get the Ipad. Since this was the exact reason I took back the Kindle, I thought I&apos;d give it a try.
I&apos;ve had the tablet for the 2 weeks and so far so good! Very easy to use, seems to have every app available a person may want and updating has been very easy. I&apos;ve updated from 3.0 to 3.2 with no problems at all. Only negative if any is the thickness due to the USB port, but that is one of the main reasons I purchased it.
Web surfing is fast and moving files is a breeze. I&apos;ve moved a bunch of music from laptop to tablet using the USB and memory stick without any problems.
I&apos;ve also sync and played music using the bluetooth hook up and worked very well with my Panasonic SCHC 55 mini stereo.
So, if your in the market for a tablet and don&apos;t want to spend a lot, this is the one for your. (I can not comment on any tablet ordered on line as I stated above, my refurbished unit was a store return)

     <Review>Pros: Daughter loved it... the short time it operated

Cons: Best Buy would not replace

I purchased the A500 on sale on the Best Buy website, as a gift for my teen. It was not misused in any way.
A few days after Christmas, after a software update, the tablet would not power up, acting as though the battery was dead, but it wouldn&apos;t charge either. We managed to reset it, but when turned on, it just immediately powered down again.
The paperwork said we could return it to a Best Buy store to get a replacement. When we did, we were told that they could not replace it because they did not have &quot;that&quot; item available any more online nor in the store, as it was discontinued. I asked for a &quot;like&quot; item replacement and they firmly refused. I was told that they&apos;d refund my money an ... d I could then purchase another.
When I got home and went online, there was the A500 on their site.
I called a manager at the store complaining. I was told that the one on the site had a different sku # than the one I purchased, so they &quot;couldn&apos;t&quot; replace it (yet it&apos;s the same product).
Another words, I bought the product on sale and they now wanted me to pay full price for it. I asked if it was some sort of gimmick.

I am planning on purchasing another tablet for my daughter, but I will not buy from Best Buy again. I&apos;ll go to Amazon, Tiger Direct, even Sears and Walmart have comparable models that I&apos;ll consider...
And I&apos;ll continue to spread the word about the poor service I got.

     <Review>My wife decided to surprise me with a tablet for Christmas but wanted me to pick one out. After some research I decided on the Iconia A500 from Acer. I made the right choice. First off, the performance is fantastic. The screen is brilliant but does have a bit of glare. No big deal though. The unit itself is a tad heavy but that&apos;s not a real issue for me either. I also love the fact that Acer didn&apos;t do much customization to this thing so you get a mostly pure Honeycomb experience. Acer has also stated that they plan on upgrading this tablet to Ice Cream Sandwich sometime in January.

I dig this tablet so much that I may pick up another for my wife.

I did also want to point out that this is the first time I&apos;ve purchased anything from MacConnection. Their customer service has bee ... n top notch and I will totally buy from them in the future.

If you&apos;re in the market for an Android tablet, this may be the one for you.

     <Review>Pros: Fast and easy to use with great flexibility

Cons: Not much

My step-son, who is a computer programmer, bought this tablet to work on some Android apps. After he finished with it he gave it to his 4 and 2 year olds to play with for several months. I rescued it from them last week with the intent of just having something to watch movies on while flying since I am in the air every other week. Imagine how surprised I was when I discovered that this thing is a serious machine that gives my laptop a run for its&apos; money. While I would like to be able to use it with Powerpoint presentations, i know that it was not designed for that, yet it does allow me to keep the PP on my tablet. I was also pleasantly surprised with how fast it is. Pages load really quickly, and videos work ver ... y well.
If you are looking for a reasonably priced tablet that gives great performance, I would recommend this one.

     <Review>Pros: Power; Features; price

Cons: Expensive wifi dongle

Good unit with plenty of power to drive my old JBL L-100/Dynaco A25 F/R combination. I pipe zone 2 to a high power FM transmitter sending internet radio anywhere on my property. I can change stations from my Android phone. I like that. Pretty easy to learn considering the amount of features. Just read the manual. I hard wired the network because the wifi module is pretty pricey.</Review>

     <Review>Pros: Battery Life; Screen size; Honeycomb 321; Full size usb; ProcessorGraphics

Cons: Screen Glare; Heavy

This is an awesome tablet. Granted, I&apos;ve only handled other tablets for a short period of time, but this thing does great what it does. Sitting on the couch surfing the net, watching Netflix, playing games. We also use it with a DSLR app to remotely control our Canon T2i, which is awesome. The full size USB was the main reason for purchasing this brand. The girlfriend also used it to keep entertained while on an extended road trip (and subsequent breakdown) with Angry Birds, which is great at the 10 inch size. You notice it&apos;s a little heavy after a while of holding it... some sort of case/stand is a must. This thing is beyond awesome.</Review>

I am new to the Android O/S, and so far have found it easy to use. Tablet itself works great and I have not issues with it. My first time purchasing a refurbished product and I must say I am very happy with it. Got it for a great price and it looks brand new.</Review>

     <Review>Very pleased with my refurbished Acer tablet. I fell like I got a great deal on a great tablet. It could be a little lighter (get&apos;s heavy after a holding it for a while) but overall, the performance and quality is what i expected. i have no qualms recommending a refurbished model, especially if it saves me a C-note over new.</Review>

     <Review>Pros: Speed, display, ease of use.

Cons: Short power cord but it&apos;s not that big of deal.

I researched many Android tablets and chose the Iconia based on all of the ports available. I wanted something to replace my laptop for travel since I really only needed to be able to access email. The tablet worked right out of the box. I had it connected to my wifi network in about 3 minutes and was surfing the web in about 5 minutes total. I installed Skype on Christmas morning and had a nice call with my father. It worked flawlessly. I was able to walk around the house and had the tablet off to everyone. The full size USB port is a huge plus since I really didn&apos;t want to be burdened with adapters and cords. I&apos;ve used it in a few public wifi hotspots with no issues. I upgraded it to 3. ... 2.1 right away and it&apos;s been trouble free.

     <Review>Pros: Good size for the kids

Cons: Doesn&apos;t work

I bought two Acer Iconia A500 Tablets for Christmas. One for my teenage son and one for my two daughters ages 10 and 8. We charged it for 6 hours (instructions said at least 4 hours). The girls loved it and played with it most of Christmas Day. The next morning it turned itself off so we assumed it needed to be charged again. I plugged it in and it has not charged above 15% and the screen will not unlock. Tried reset button on side with no success. I am going to attempt to return it to Best Buy today and hope that their customer service is all that they say it is. My son&apos;s tablet has had no issues so far, but he wasn&apos;t using his as much as the other one was being used. I was originally going to buy an IPAD, but though the Acer w ... as a better choice. I&apos;m questioning that decision now. I am very disappointed in this product as it should last more than a day considering all the &quot;android&quot; hype.

     <Review>Pros: The price and performance equal a great value

Cons: WiFi range MAY be an issue but your mileage may vary

First, I have to qualify this review by saying that I&apos;m a Mac guy. I bought this tablet as an entry level reader/browser for my GF. Did a LOT of research on the different brands and devices and settled on the Iconia Tab A500 largely due to price and Acer has a pretty good rep. with me. It feels solid and not too heavy. Button and port layout is good, nothing seems to get in the way. The display is bright and vivid. Performance and switching between apps is crisp and snappy. I had a hard time finding anything really wrong with this device and I actually am thinking about getting one for myself in a couple of months.

My only complaint is that the WiFi range MAY ... be an issue. The signal strength icon reports less than full strength even next to my router. But, disconnection or speed problems have not occurred so maybe its just an inaccurate representation of sig. strength.

All in all, a great unit and I&apos;m very happy with my choice.

As a side note, this tablet gets really bad reviews at most of the big tech magazine sites but they just generally say that &quot;its nothing new&quot;. Not sure what that means. If you want a big screen tablet that performs well and has more options than units that are $100 more then this is the one you want.

     <Review>Pros: Bright and sharp display; Future android upgrades; USB port; Runs latest android; HDMI out; fast and smoothe

Cons: GPS is quirkey; Battery is questionable; Mic is muddled sounding; Outdoors screen is poor

Great for playing videos and nice nice smooth video even on streaming flash sites. Hdmi out works great. When I Skype, people tell me the sound they receive is slightly muddled. If they could fix this it would get 5 stars. Cameras are decent. Takes a while to acquire GPS signal. Best tablet for the price. [$] for refurb is unbeatable for 10&quot; tab of this caliber.</Review>

     <Review>Pros: Web Browsing; Operating System; Screen; Battery Life; WiFi; Easy To Customize; App Availablity

Cons: Some non-removable apps

I&apos;ve had &apos;touchscreen envy&apos; for the past year and decided to remedy the situation. This Acer tablet does everything I want and more. My main purpose is to use it when I travel for checking email and web browsing. The android layout is easy to figure out. The battery life is decent.
My only complaint is I am unable to remove the preloaded apps that I don&apos;t use.</Review>

     <Review>Pros: price, ease of use, battery life

Cons: have to get a converter program for movies.

I&apos;ve had this for a couple months and I love it. I hadn&apos;t used Android before so it took some getting used to. There are plenty of apps in the Android store so that isn&apos;t a problem for me. My only complaint is trying to get movies downloaded. You need a converter for that and as I am not tech savvy about this kind of thing I haven&apos;t attempted to try. I would like to get some on for when I go on the road (I don&apos;t think you can rent movies from the Android store when you are out of the country but I&apos;m not for sure on that). Other than that I love it. Hooked it up to my laptop and it synced up no problem. I highly recommend this for anyone wanting to try a tablet.</Review>

     <Review>Pros: Like new; Great price

Cons: Backlighting; a bit heavy

What&apos;s Great:
1). Refurbished device looks and works as new including registration with Acer for updates.
2). For games, movies and surfing this device is perfect and extremely fast and stable.
3).The large screen looks great when looked at straight-on.
4). The battery life is very good.
5). Easy software and wireless setup.
6). This would get a 4-Star rating but the price is what pushes me to a 5-Star rating.
7). Aluminum and black appearance is attractive and seems very sturdy, albeit a bit heavy especially for reading.

My only complaints are minor:
1). The backlight is very dim along the edges if not being views straight-on.
2). The touch screen occasionally flakes out when using ... a stylus. May be the stylus though. Never had any issues when using my fingers.
3). The volume toggle is almost flush with the edge of the tablet making it a bit tough to adjust at times. Small &quot;+&quot; and &quot;-&quot; buttons would probably work better.
4). The power and headphone jacks should be along the top edge (opposite the docking port). When turned on the profile end, one of the jacks is sticking out.

The tablet battery comes discharged. You need to charge it for almost 5 hours before it can even come on. It is a bit on the heavy side. But it is very fast. It is easy to use.</Review>

     <Review>Pros: Could see possiblities

Cons: Acer customer service

I bought this tablet because of the what was being offered at the time. It was a good price. This is day 5 and I&apos;m still trying to get my problem resolved. Acer starts off saying I have a limited warranty? I had only had it three days how limited could it be?

The on screen keyboard would come on at times and at times I couldn&apos;t get it on screen. Then I kept getting a message to &quot;force out&quot; or &quot;report&quot;. Don&apos;t know what that&apos;s about.

I e-mailed Acer, couldn&apos;t stand the thought of having to spend half my day on the phone. They do not carefully read the e-mail. Everything they tell me to do I had already done with no results.

I could not get on their sites recommended by clicking their link. When I try ... to go on Acer support site I couldn&apos;t get on, it kept timing out.

Even if I where to take it back I&apos;m stuck with a two year Sprint contract I had to sign up with as part of the sale. Ughhhhh. So sorry I bought this thing.

     <Review>This is my first tablet (that I kept at least). I got a Viewsonic ViewPad 10, but had lots of problems, so I returned it. I went to a couple chain stores and played with a bunch of tablets al afternoon and decided on this. Ordered it, and got it from the store quickly. Opened the box, charged it and it started working right away. It is easy to use. Ther screen and touch are great. My wife has an iPad which I was using. I am very happy with the performance of this compaired to that. Cons: I have had a couple unexpected program closures. The screen adjust when changinf from verticle to horizontal (and back) is slightly slower than the iPad.</Review>

This is probably the best value for an up-to-date (3.2) Android around. It&apos;s reasonably thin and light. Has the 3.2 update. An actual USB port for connecting a keyboard or mouse. A micro HDMI port. A micro SD slot. 1200x800 display. My heavens... what&apos;s not to like?</Review>

     <Review>Pros: Good battery life; Easy to navigate; Great tablet; Lots of apps

Picked this up for my daughter who is a Jr in college and she loves it. Hasn&apos;t picked up her laptop in over a month. Looking for USB keyboard, once purchased I don&apos;t know if her laptop will get much use. Added 16G card so lots of storage. Wife has Ipad and I&apos;ve used both. This a bit heavier, but like it more. Little difference on surfing web, email, etc.</Review>

     <Review>Pros: Quality product

Cons: nothing so far

I&apos;ve owned several IPad&apos;s including the IPad 2. No doubt they are awesome and easy to use. I decided to save a little money and read the reviews on the A500. BB had them on sale for $349.99 so I took the plunge. Nice tablet! Quick response with the right app playes any movie format I throw at it. I belive this is a Ipad competitor. With the android market growing everyday you have plenty of choices. I would not hesitate to pick one of these up!!!!!</Review>

I really like this tablet. I got it for my husband so I could download &quot;Text to Speech&quot; as he can&apos;t talk. It took awhile for me to find the program and since then it&apos;s been a dream to use. Just haven&apos;t figured out how to use the &quot;web cam&quot; yet.</Review>

     <Review>The tablet was actually a gift for my wife. It has a beautiful screen, works with a number of thumb drives (haven&apos;t had one fail yet), is easy to navigate, fast response, and has beautiful graphics.
Good points:
No memory issues (at least not yet)
Very responsive multi-touch controls
Adapts well to changing orientation
Fast
Excellent sound quality, with good volume

Bad points:
Battery life not quite what I had hoped, but is fair
Sometimes a little too responsive when trying to configure the desktop (Probably an Android issue, not the tablet)
Automatic updates should be more configurable
Should include a file browser (I had to download from the Android Market).</Review>

We use this as an interface to the web, and it is great for that.

The only problem is that Staples leaves their rebate pricing up after the rebate is over giving you false sense of the price. I would have still bought it, but it was disappointing.</Review>

     <Review>Pros: EVERYTHING!

Cons: NOT MANY ACCESSORIES AVAILABLE YET (NO OTTERBOX)

Did a lot of research before buying this tablet, and found this tablet to have the most features for the money, without compromising quality. I even got a $50 Best Buy gift card with my purchase! This tablet feels very solid and sturdy in your hands. It recently updated to Honeycomb 3.2, and although a lot of people say there are no benefits for larger screen tablets, I find it more stable and faster when transitioning between applications with this update. I have not experience hangs or lock ups like some other reviewers say, but then again, Android OSs are a work in progress. The sound is amazing when compared to other tablets. Screen resolution and display are excellent. But even though the Aconia has ... better resolution than my IPad 2, the Ipad still looks better. The Acer is way faster on Wifi than the iPad2, though, and best of all, it plays flash. It also recently updated to Flash 11. I have not encountered a website with flash that I can not access or play media from. the full size usb is a definite plus and other more expensive tablet don&apos;t offer it. I will be adding 32gb of memory soon, so I can carry all my movies with me. If you are looking for a tablet to lay around the house or take on the go and look at your email, surf the internet, play media and games, read books, etc.. this is definitely the way to go.

     <Review>If you look around and read reviews you will quickly see that this Acer tablet beats all other brands (yes even the iPad) hands down. My hubby decided that he&apos;d like to buy me one a few months ago so we began shopping around. The reviews on this (a seemingly small brand) we amazing compared to most others. People were buying this to replace their I pads. So we gave it a try and now we don&apos;t knw why we didn&apos;t buy one earlier.

Battery Life

Previously I owned and used a netbook. My biggest complaint there was the lack of battery life, maybe two hrs. This little tablet amazes me with the length of the battery, upwards eight or more hours use age time and when the battery is dying it takes forever to use the last little bit of battery so you have plenty of time to finish up what y ... ou are working on and save you work before it shuts down.

Processing Speed

SUPER Fast!!! Makes everything else I use, desktop, netbook and phone seem to crawl. Even when running several apps or having several windows open.

Weight

Very lightweight, ESP compared to my netbook., makes its portability a real plus.

App Availability

I have found everything I&apos;ve looked for thus far, Microsoft equivalent software for tablets so I am able to run all of my Microsoft Office docs easily, games like angry birds, learning games and apps for the kids, etc.

Durability

I run a daycare and have two kids of my own who think the tablet belongs to them at times, so it is roughly handled, dropped on occasion, used with dirty hands, etc and holds up consistently.

     <Review>Pros: Looks good, supports microSDHC cards and usb sticks

Cons: lack of 3G/4G. There&apos;s an empty slot for where it should go, but it&apos;s taped over. Don&apos;t put anything into it though.

Not a whole lot of complaints with this tablet. It runs fine and plays vids. It&apos;s definitely not capable of playing 1080p content, but convert it down to size and it looks fine. It&apos;s overheated and froze up on me before, but that&apos;s cause I use it in my car. It was sitting in the sun and froze up when I came back to use it.

Wish, the thing had more video codec support. Course, it&apos;d be the exact same thing with any other tablet. I just end up converting vids to put onto it. It comes with a bit of bloatware for it. There&apos;s like 4 different video players on it.

I have it wirelessly connec ... t to my car stereo via bluetooth. Sounds great. The internal speakers are fairly loud, but don&apos;t expect much. It is a thin tablet after all. I also use a pair of Audio Technica A700 headphones with it and it comes out as good as my mp3 player. Sounds better than my last two Android phones too.

The only thing I wish it had, is 3G/4G. For now, I just set my phone as a wireless hotspot and connect that way, but I&apos;d prefer to not have to drain my phone&apos;s battery to use internet on my tablet, while on the move.

     <Review>First of all I have it only for two weeks so it may be that some problems came from my ignorance, I did not even try everything. Today I tried voice recording, it stops when screen goes off, and recording was lower quality than on my phone. I had to download other app for voice recording. Problems with external memory card, if I go to settings- storage-extrenal I can see how much is used and how much free space but no other program see that I have external SD. Gtalk does not work (and that creates some problems with Market), I found some things on the web about that issue. All in all it is not straightforward and easy beginning. I already spent to much time resolving those problems. Good things I am satisfied with speed, quality of display and general performance.</Review>

     <Review>Pros: Fast; Easy To Use; Powerful

Amazing piece of machine. Does everything you can ask for a tablet to do. Movies and Video chatting are great. Battery life is 8 hours of music and movies with wifi off. If your wifi is on i would say more along the lines of 5 to 6. The ports available on this is what really makes it.</Review>

     <Review>Pros: Features for the price

Cons: Wish the charger cord was longer and they used full size USB or micro port plug to charge

Purchased this item after long research. It may be a little bulkier than the IPAD but out performs it hands down.
Expandable Memory via Micro SD Card, uo to 32 GB, Full size and Micro USB ports allow for easy transfer of pics, music, documants from your big box machine to the tablet. Videos play smoothly, sound is great. I use it to read at the pool (not as good as a Kindle, but better than an IPAD) and listen to music. Mobile Dolby sounds great! Long battery life as well.
Dollar for dollar agreat value, lots of bang for the buck. 3 associates have bought one after playing around with mine.</Review>

     <Review>Pros: Easy To Use

Cons: Touch screen lacks

The Acer tablet was a great buy for [$], even if it was just a splurge purchase for a new toy. It allows for downloading applications on the Google Market Network which I love because you can find just about anything for free. My only complaint is after using the tablet for an extended amount of time, it gets so warm that it no longer recognizes the user&apos;s touch thus renders the tablet useless until it cools down. Because of the buy, I will probably downgrade my phone service and save $30 a month on data charges because the tablet does it all except phone calls.</Review>

     <Review>Pros: Able to add aditional memory.

Cons: Weight with the Targus cover.

Much better than the iPad. This device has USB ports for a mouse, keyboard, flash drive, etc. A mini HDMI port. Two speakers with near quality sound. Much higher sound over the iPad. A microSD slot that can be expanded to 32 GB. 5 megapixle camera with zoom up to 8X. Everything I wanted in a tablet and more! It&apos;s a little heavier but I&apos;m sure that the newer model will come down in weight. Plus it&apos;s $100 less than the iPad.</Review>

     <Review>There is still some lags with windows switching, but this is due to Android 3.1 still need performance tuning. This unit is heavier than others due to steel construction vs. plastic. All in all, I&apos;m happy with my purchase.</Review>

Cons: Had to replace it once, the internet is sometimes slower than necessary.

The tab is excellent for the price. The wifi is good, but sometimes not as strong as it should be. Easy to add apps to and manage the internet. A little difficult to figure out how to pull up different features or how to edit things desktops with the istruction manuals that are given with it. Had to replace my first one... the GPS feature didn&apos;t work and the internet stopped working entirely. The 2nd one has had no problems.</Review>

     <Review>Pros: Gorilla Glass Screen; Easy To Set Up; Easy To Use

Cons: Can be slow at times; On the heavy side

Staples e-mailed me a $100 off coupon for any tablet so I couldn&apos;t pass this up. The Acer is heavier than other tablets, but for me that isn&apos;t a deal breaker. The screen is made of Gorilla Glass - very tough and scratch resistant - a definite plus. A full-size USB 2.0 port is another plus. I like being able to use a flash drive to upload or download ... much easier than those higher priced tablets out on the market. Overall, I am very happy with this purchase.</Review>

     <Review>Pros: Fast; Powerful; Easy To Use; Easy To Set Up

Bought this tablet a few weeks ago for [$] with the $100 coupon. Great deal. I already had an Android phone, so the transition was a natural one. Watching movies on it is great but using the HDMI out connector to connect it to your HDTV results in a picture that isn&apos;t quite optimal. However, the Android software and apps are getting better everyday and should improve the video experience in no time!! Very easy to transfer video, pictures, music, whatever, to the device via USB, SD card, or connecting it directly to your computer. My Iconia compares to Samsung, Motorola, Toshiba, and others quite well.</Review>

     <Review>Pros: Easy to use, loads of fun. It just works

Cons: The microphone on the video camera. But hey, I have a smart phone for Video...

I purchased this tablet a few days ago. As soon as I turned it on it asked me to connect to Wi-Fi and then did a system update. I integrated my existing Google account that is shared with my Droid X2. Everything moved over perfectly. I was able to link up my corporate email with no problems. The screen is big and bright. The touch responsiveness seems a little slow at times compared to my Droid phone but maybe I’m just not used to it. Not a big issue at all. Web browsing is awesome. Looks just like Chrome on my computer. The honeycomb OS is pretty slick. It literally took me like 10 minutes to figure it out compared to gingerbread on my phone. Th ... e look and feel of the tablet is awesome. It is a bit heavy but it feels sturdy and well made. The microphone is terrible. I have taken video holding the tablet narrating and I can barely hear myself on play back. One final thing, I plugged my Logitech keyboard and mouse combo receiver and both worked within seconds. I attached it to my big screen TV using an HDMI cable and was web surfing from my couch via my wireless keyboard and mouse. Very cool!!

     <Review>Pros: Responsive Graphics and Durability.

Cons: The back button on the screen makes a mechanical noise. Might have to compare to another device to see if this is normal

I got this with the 100.00 gift card so overall the full price was only $300.00 for this Tablet/Pad. More cost efficient than most Smart Phones. And, with all the Great Android applications this is quite a bargain ! The touch surface is very very responsive, quick and accurate ! I can play a 3d game on this pad, and the keyboard for typing notes is a perfect size. I bought this just to develop an test my applications and games on. but WOW, this thing really is incredible. I&apos;d be worried if I was Apple ! However, Ipad3 is going to blow everything away in terms of speed, graphics and sheer technological excellen ... ce, but for an arm and a leg. If you want cost efficiency, this is the tablet for you. Quality, technological finesse and durability. You can get two of these for the price of one iPad2. LOL

Hopefully Acer and the Android Honeycomb OS will continue to add USB functionality.
This unit does all that an Android tablet can do and at a great price relative to others.</Review>

     <Review>Pros: screen, easy setup

Cons: not a laptop replacement

It&apos;s a very well built tablet. For the most part it&apos;s easy to setup, dl applications, and setup wifi and email. The screen is nice and bright and very clear. As far as tablet goes, this is as good as any.

One of the first things I tried to do was to sync up with my work&apos;s exchange server. It comes with Android 3.0 and after banging my head trying to get it to sync with my work&apos;s exchange server, I gave up. Later that day it asked me if I wanted to upgrade to the latest version of Andriod 3.1 - once I did that it would allow me to sync up with with the exchange server.

I also noticed that devices like the Motorola Xoom will have Andriod 3.3 - not sure what advantage that has.

I also realized that a ta ... blet is a very cool toy and a great way to access information. However to distribute information you really need a keyboard. Tapping out emails isn&apos;t efficient. It takes a while and there&apos;s many more misspellings. It&apos;s not a laptop replacement, the technology isn&apos;t there yet.

     <Review>Pros: USB support; Fast; Easy To Set Up; Powerful; Easy To Use

Cons: Slow adoption by DRM apps

I picked this up on sale from Staples. When first shopping for a tablet, I would not have paid full price ([$]), but after using it a couple weeks I would not hesitate to do so if I had to buy it again. It is a great alternative to the more expensive ipad. You gain some features that the ipad does not have, but there are some trade offs. If you want a tablet for watching movies, look elsewhere as DRM apps such as Netflix and Hulu are not supported currently on this device (look at other model android tablets or the ipad). I use mine extensively for work and it is a great alternative to packing a laptop when traveling. Pair a bluetooth keyboard and a wireless mouse and connect to a ... remote PC with one of the many remote desktop apps available allows you to stay fully connected to the office. Web browsing and email work quite well. It is pretty quick and seemed very comparable to other tablets in this price range. The external USB support and micro SD were a huge bonus. The great sale staples had easily pushed this to the top of the list. As others have mentioned, the power cord for the charger is short, but it holds a charge well, so it&apos;s not too big a deal. Overall, I&apos;m very happy with it and would buy the same model again.

     <Review>Pros: It is far superior to other tablets costing a lot more. The expand-ability market is still growing so be patient.

Cons: The price I paid was $449, a month later, it was $399, wahhhh $50.

This tablet rules. It has many features the ipad and other tablets on the market just don&apos;t have. I love the micro SD slot and a BIG factor on the purchase of this tablet was that it had a FULL sized USB port and a micro USB port. I can take a thumb drive loaded with music, pictures, video, whatever and plug it in to the side and shoot the files over to the tablet.

The display is awesome!!!! The use of gorilla glass was a big factor in the purchase of this particular tablet. The screen is sharp and very clear. THE ONLY THING YOU NEED TO DO TO THE SCREEN IS GET A ZAG PROTECTOR. Th ... e screen is so flat and crystal clear that your fingerprints will grow and smudges will build up pretty quick. With my pass-code being visual, I don&apos;t want to leave a fingerprint trail for someone to see.

The two cameras are a nice touch too. The video recordings out of the tablet are satisfactory but I am very picky about the image I see. The camera shots from the rear camera are very clear. I don&apos;t think I would use the front facing camera too much and haven&apos;t really. It&apos;s only 2 megapixels.

     <Review>Pros: The price.

Cons: It&apos;s Heavy

I bought this pretty much on reviews and price. I wish I would have researched tablets more. It&apos;s too bad you can&apos;t try out the ones that you&apos;re interested in before you make your purchase. I did not get a 3 or 4G connection with it. I need wi-fi to get the internet. That&apos;s inconvenient. The acer&apos;s a bit thick and heavy and for a few dollars more I could have got an ipad 2. The touch screen sensitivity is tricky. I&apos;ve used the ipad 2 and it seems to be more ergonomic as far as &quot;feel&quot;. I wish I would have bought it instead. Overall, it&apos;s a nice piece of electronics and I enjoy it because I have to.</Review>

     <Review>Pros: most every thing

Cons: battery life could maybe be extended

I bought this specifically to use in France in July 2011. I only had the WiFi version, but where ever I had WiFi connection, it worked very well indeed. Other reviews mention that its only real drawback is its weight, but I did not find that a problem. Rarely did I ever need to hold it, it was usually on my lap or on a desk. Screen visibility is excellent, as is the reponse time for screens. Not having used a touch screen unit before, I was not familiar with how to get to everything, so it was not as intuitive as I would have liked, but for someone familiar with iPhones etc., it was simple to use. I have not been able to compare it against other similar systems, but I would give this a 4.5 star review.</Review>

     <Review>First tablet to own &amp; very impressed. I especially like the full size usb port, which allows me to plug in a 500GB passport drive for extra storage. With a purchased app, I can log into the office through a vpn connection, &amp; check on processes I left running as well as use design programs to get information. My D300 camera can be plugged into the tablet to give me a 10 screen while using the Live View setting. So many things I can use this tablet for, especially while traveling, saving me from having to lug around my regular laptop. The only thing I don&apos;t like about this tablet is not being able to remove some of the apps that came with it for which I have no use. The games being one example.</Review>

This is a replacement . First one i bought battery died within 2 weeks and locked up. Couldnt get into the unit to do a factory reset. I see they changed the recharging cord on the replacement unit. This tells me they were aware of problem. [...]</Review>

     <Review>Pros: 2 cameras; Responsive Touch Screen; USB Ports; Easy To Use; HDMI Port; Easy To Set Up; Fast; Stylish

Cons: Print drivers

I have had my A500 since April when it came out, Very Very Happy with it. I also have had the 1st Gen Ipad for a year now, and was going to get the Ipad 2 but decided to look at the new Android Tablets with Honeycomb. After comparing the specs of the main players I found that the Acer was the best value and more features. I also am happy with the acer brand as I have 2 Acer netbooks that have preformed well the last 2 years. The update to 3.1 has made impovements. Family and friends have been impressed by the quality of the camera pics and video. I like the HDMI out port for connecting to my large screen tv. Also the Micro SD slot or the USB slot f ... or loading pics and Movies, so much easier than loading them onto my ipad. As for Accessories for A500, the options are getting better monthly and becoming cheaper. Found a nice functional cover for under $14 on an auction site.So with the price Drop last month to [$] and [...]k I had to pick up another, time to retire the netbooks.

     <Review>Pros: Overall performance, quality, USB and Flash support

I am very pleased with this tablet. Having a full USB port is a huge benefit and allows this tablet to be a viable alternative to my regular laptop PC when away from the office. While slightly heavier than the iPad/iPad2, it has a nice feel and I&apos;ve not found the weight to be an issue. The availability and choice of Android app&apos;s is fine, although I have experienced quite a few &quot;forced closes&quot; (Android/Honeycomb issue, not Acer). Another nice feature is Flash support. Speed, overall performance, and responsiveness of touch screen is very good. Camera is excellent. Accessories such as cases and stands are available - look online or at Staples.</Review>

     <Review>Pros: Full Size USB port, Micro HDMI port, Micro SD Card Slot, Fast and Responsive

Cons: Nothing that I have found yet!

Before I bought this tablet I read tons of reviews for different tablets out there and settled on the Acer A500. I can say it was the right choice. The A500 has everything you will need in a tablet. HDMI port, FULL SIZED USB PORT!!, Micro Usb port and Micro SD Card slot. All these extras do make it a bit heavier then other tablets, but it is worth the little extra heft to it to be able to slap a flash drive or external hard drive on it... or keyboard.. or ps3 controller. Its fast and responsive, and the price point cant be beat. For those of you that are scared away a bit by the fact it is made by Acer and not some other big name, dont be. It is quality all ... the way around. They have also just dropped the Honeycomb 3.1 update on it so its running the most up to date OS as well. I&apos;ve been using it for a few weeks now and you cant pry it out of my hot little fists. I highly recommend it to anyone looking for a tablet.

     <Review>Pros: everything

Cons: netflix is not compatible yet

Before I bought this tab, I was searching and comparing tablets for about two months. I didn&apos;t want to spend $600 just for a tablet alone but I also didn&apos;t want to waste my money on a cheap tab. What it all came down to was the Ipad two, Acer a500 and the galaxy. I had a problem with the ipad because its just a over grown Itouch fourth generation with video editing softwear and that the galaxy is so expensive. So I started looking into the Acer a bit more and I found that it is so over shadowed by these over priced tabs and does not get the credit it deserves. This tab is fantastic. It does everything I wanted in a tab and now even more with the new 3.1 update. The only real problem I could find is that Netflix is not compa ... tible yet with this unit. They are working on the issue of piracy and once they have that figured out they will release Netflix for this tab. The battery life is really good especially if you just turn the screen brightness down.

the screen is very bright and has a great resolution even when it is turned down to save battery. the responsiveness is just a &quot;bit&quot; slower but believe me that is nothing worth turning this tab down for. the speed of web browsing is great! when i was playing with it in best buy i was a little worried that it would be a little slow but onece i got it home and working on a stable wifi it worked incredibly. the gameplay on this tab is great to. the gamplay is very smooth making that experiance very pleasing. and personaly the editing softwear that came with the 3.1 update and the fact that you can use a mouse and keyboard combo with the usb port puts this tab above the ipad2. especially once netfix releases the new app for this tab.

all in all this tab is amazing. the screen brightness and resolution, the keyboard and mouse compadibility (not including the usb controller that can be used on it), and massive android app store. dont judge this tab on the price alone but rather everything you are getting for the price. especi ...

     <Review>Pros: Decent price for the features

Cons: Keyboard takes some adjusting to, short charging cord.

Have had this tablet for a couple of months now and my only complaint is that it doesn&apos;t handle 1080p video as well as the Xoom, but that&apos;s something I can live with since I don&apos;t use it for that very much. I was able to setup Acer Sync after a little bit of fiddling, so sending e-books to it was easy enough. I did root mine using GingerBreak, because I wanted to really see how much battery life I could squeeze out of it, and with doing my usual half speed when the screen is off, I can get two days of &quot;sleep&quot; out of it. I can get roughly 15 hours or so of on and off usage from it. Also one thing I love is the fact I can plug my thumb drive into it and it will let me transfer files ... that way as well. Handy for grabbing something on the go. Also if you add in Dropbox, that makes it easy to get files loaded at your computer before your even home, another plus. I also needed to charge my phone in a pinch the other day when the power failed, and the Iconia was able to do so! A very nice tablet overall, I download my podcasts to it, I use it to instant message, and I surf the web. I added the Origami stand because that also works with the Iconia, and I have the Apple Wireless Keyboard so it was a good fit :)

Cons: Not alot of accessories out for it YET.

Got this for my wife&apos;s B-Day present. She LOVED it! She is big into watching Youtube videos, cooking, crafts, and so on...The large screen provides a crisp, clear picutre quality with excellant color. I also purchased the Acer cover/stand for it and it works great too. Allows you to prop the tablet up for easier viewing.</Review>

Cons: Lack of Accessories. Not much of a Selections out there.

This tablet is by far the best out there on the market. The Price is Perfect, It has Every Feature. USB, Micro USB, HDMI out and Docking Port. And Most Tablets Lack Full USB Support unless they have a docking station. Ive been really pleased with the look and feel and responsiveness. This is the best Tablet out there. Ive played with the Xoom and why pay 200 more when the Acer does 10x more for 200 less.</Review>

     <Review>This tablet has been an absolute pleasure to use. Snappy interface, easy to navigate, and trumps the I pad in virtually everything but the app market. If you use an android phone and have a google account, all of you contacts, email, calendar items, and even apps can be syncronized between your android devices for free. I believe Apple charges $100 a year for this service through Mobile Me.

Great build quality and very aestetically pleasing. Functional MicroSD slot, full size USB port for flash drives means you&apos;ll never be locked into a finite amount of storage. Micro HDMI out works beautifully and without the need for special adapters.

Only one reason to go with the pricier, more plastic-y Motorola Xoom: Acer&apos;s bootloader is currently locked, preventing you from installing c ... ustom ROMs and recovering the software if the unit won&apos;t boot. If you plan on experimenting with different OS&apos;es, go with the Xoom. In the meantime, I&apos;ve got my fingers crossed over Acer unlocking their bootloader.

All-in-all, you will absolutely love this thing. Not much to hate. Now if Best Buy can just get some accessories for it, I&apos;ll be all set.

     <Review>Pros: quality build, screen, performance, wifi

Cons: the acer case is pricey but works well.

I have been waiting and reading up on tablets for months. I was thinking to buy the Iconia A500, but after reading about the Asus see transformer, decided to wait for that product thinking that it be the best quality and value. I ordered the Asus after it finally became available and got it this week. I spent one night with it and was really disappointed. If you are looking for the Asus because of the keyboard-dock functionality then perhaps it makes a little sense. I found it to be cheap and flimsy feeling and actually had a audable creak along a side seam. The sound was terrible and it was uncomfortable to hold. I returned it the next day. I then purchased the a500 and let me tell y ... ou I could not be happier. The quality feel of the tablet is so superior. This is an awsome device. The screen also has gorilla glass in case you didn&apos;t know! The sound from the speakers is vastly superior to the Asus eee. The only concern I had in buying the a500 was all the talk about weak wifi performance. I can say the wifi works strong and clear both at home and at the office. BUY IT!

     <Review>Pros: USB, Price

Cons: WiFi, Unresponsive Screen, power cable length

I have had this from the day it got released. About 3 to 4 weeks now.

CONS:
- Short power supply cable. Really short!!!
- Volume rocker button is horizontal. For me, the &quot;up / down&quot; intuitive is a norm &amp; having to go left / right is cumbersome. Plus adjusting it when in landscape mode is an inconvenience
- Lack of accessories - cases, dock, etc. There is close to ZERO eco system surrounding this product.
- The above inhibits the ability to extend the value prop of this product thereof.

- MY BIGGEST GRIPE: WiFi.
--- I keep losing my WiFi signal &amp; hence had to set up a bunch of APs across the house from my very old wireless routers in my electronic discarded pile. (Knew I w ... ould have some use for them someday!!!)
--- I have changed the settings, but no avail.

- NEXT BIGGEST GRIPE: Unresponsive screen @ start up
--- Several times over the past 3/4 weeks, upon hitting the power button, i get the &quot;unlock&apos; screen; but completely unresponsive.
--- I need to &apos;power off&quot; and recycle - which takes about 10 to 15 seconds to cycle and get online.
--- The above, imho, is not a *true&quot; tablet experience - since one of the key attributes is the ability to be instantly on.

- GPS: It is there &amp; works. But not the greatest. I was @ the Boeing Air Museum over the weekend, sitting outside and it took 4ever to get a GPS lock. Hence don&apos;t trust the GPS if you are walking about.
- In built offline maps to cater for GPS. Sure you can DL mapdroyd - but why would it not be already installed?

- Distribution of weight. It is a heavy tablet and you cannot hold it any single position for long.
- Camera is so-so. Tried to take pix @ the museum (inside &amp; outside). Blurry.

PROS:
- Installed apps
- Clear.Fi
- Installed games
- Fit / finish of the product (even tho&apos; some members claimed as if the product was slipping away from their grasp)
- LOVE LOVE LOVE the USB. This was a HUGE selling point.
- Price point ... again a plus

CONCLUSION:
I&apos;m not sure. Even though I gave it 4 stars, I&apos;m leaning t ...

     <Review>Pros: Ports for everything and price

Cons: Does not play any movies smoothly and a bit heavy.

So. I give this a 3 because everything about it is awesome other than 2 things. Unfortunately, 1 of those things is a big enough deal Im returning this after only 2 days.
First is weight. Its a bit heavy, but I knew that buying it and decided that was ok with all the ports I get.
Second and most important is video though. I have all my DVDs and Blu-Rays backed up to mp4, high profile, resolutions from 480p to 1080p. I tried every player in the market and the built in one, and not one video played smoothly on this thing. I searched the web and many people said it was encoding or the Tegra. This is BS. Nvidias specs on the Tegra 2 specifically say it has hardware decoding, the Xo ... om does fine up to 720p, and I also own a Galaxy Tab that since day one could play all the way up to 1080p perfectly! If that little single core thing can play anything I throw at it, this is just sad I cant even play a 480p on this Iconia, back to the store it goes. Useless to me.

Cons: Micro SD!! Why with all that space

Shame on any device manufacture that makes a 7inch or larger device with a micro sd slot. Devices that large should have full sd. Micro sd slots should be kept to hand held phones, PC tablets should have full size SD slots.</Review>

     <Review>Pros: Speed, Stability and Ports.

Cons: WIFI Signal was very bad and I would have added a regular SD port instead or along with the Micro SD.

Received unit today and it was very much a let down. First thing and main thing that was noted was the signal quality of the WIFI connection. You had to be within 5 feet on router to even get full signal. Within 10 feet it went to 3 bars. At about 20 feet it bounced from 2 to 1 bar. Even disconnected many times. Laptop sitting next ti it has full signal and works perfect. Main issue with a unit that depends totally on WIFI. You may travel and be in places with questionable connection and strength and not at a location you know the wireless layout and where the routers are located.
Far as the applications and speed I had no issues. Se ... tup was easy and just as Android has been with other devices and phones. Unit was responsive to touch and screen was nice and clear. Little heavy compared to Ipad but noted considering addition of ports.
Plan on returning tomorrow and waiting for other brands or changing. This was a real let down considering my luck with Acer in the past. They could have done much better. Unit was well constructed and sturdy. Liked the Metal but disliked the plastic screen. If you are going to do a sturdy unit then the screen surface should be very sturdy as well.

     <Review>Pros: screen, video play, battery life, full size USB 2.0 port

Cons: cant charge through USB, some apps dont work properly

I bought this tablet after playing with the display in the store and I have to tell you I&apos;m glad I did. The video performance from the Nvidia dual core is flawless and smooth, the 10.1&quot; screen is bright and clear. a few bugs need to be worked out because Skype doesnt work but that&apos;s not a big deal , this unit also supports mass storage devices such as USB drives and external hard drives and with the micro sd card slot this units storage capabilities are endless unlike the iPad. The battery life is fantastic, I have gotten 7+ hours on a single charge , unfortunately you cant charge through the USB port but you cant have everything. all in all a great table ... t and well worth the money.

     <Review>Pros: Well built quality; Easy To Set Up; Easy To Use; Powerful; Fast

I went to [...] and played around with their display model, and I must admit that I was quite impressed. I do love Apple&apos;s products and I do own the newest Ipod Touch, but I wanted a tablet that runs on Android 3.0. I bought the Acer Iconia A500 and I have not been disappointed. It is smooth, and fast operationwise, and it looks great with its aluminum clad back, and large bright display. The only disappointment I have thus far is the lack of accessories to compliment it. This is a great deal in comparison the Asus Transformer since the Acer has the USB port that you can add a flash drive or other USB powered device to. It has a very solid feel, and the extra weight is not noticable at all. It supports fla ... sh, which is something that Apple OS does not. A must have for all of you tech geeks. I highly recommend it.

     <Review>Pros: low price, stylish, expendable,

Cons: lack of 3G connection

I take many time to choice and decide to take a set of A500. I read all reviews from user whom using this tablet for along time. Also it has a bit mistake and heavier than others left but not at all. I like the stylish solid view, much connect, expendable, and price are acceptable. I will recommend to my friends.</Review>

     <Review>Pros: Great price, long battery life, hdmi out, usb in and it runs Anroid Honeycomb.

Cons: Short power cord and lock screen button could be better.

Being an early I pad owner, I wanted to upgrade to an Android tablet. The I pad is a really good tablet, but it has just too many restrictions for me.

I did a lot of research and I really like this tablet, it feels solid and runs smoothly. Back camera takes good pics, the front is just OK. I like that it has hdmi out and the USB input.

Honeycomb is awesome and so much better than iOS. I love being able to customize my homepage and the widgets...I can view many things without having to go in and out of applications. The browser is great and it runs fast, but when visiting a lot of sites, I was going to their mobile si ... te. I fixed that by going in to debug mode and changed it to desktop and all is good. I&apos;m looking forward to an update and a few bug fixes and
hopefully more features will be added. With Android, the sky is the limit.

     <Review>Pros: Everything but HD video playback and washed out colors.

Cons: HD video playback and screen not being ISP with 16 million colors, killed it for me.

Overall this thing is great, however it didn&apos;t suit my requierment of what I wanted out of it and that&apos;s HD video playback. It is severely lacking in this department, due soley too(in my opinion) the screen. The 262K colors and non ISP screen make the picture extremely washed out and not sharp when compared to the IPad 2&apos;s display with 16 million colors. I knew this going into it, but gave it a shot anyhow. The HD videos I tried were all in mp4 format, stock video player was used as well as MOBOPlayer. Video was jerky and slowed down with soft edges, detracting from the HD quality significantly. Tried same file using MOBOPlay ... er, file played better but still not 100% smooth and the same soft edged appearance remained. The A500 is also finicky with bit rate to allow playback. I found the videos I had in the upper 2,000&apos;s would have issue, yet another video with 3,600 bitrate played fine for smoothness, yet still lacked the fidelity of an HD video. All mp4 files were 720p( as a side note, these same files played flawlessly in the IPad 2, using the IPad 2 stock player, with the crispness and fidelity you would expect from a 720p video). Standard def. .avi files were acceptable, depening on encoding(some looked better than others). With all that being said, the rest of the device is excellent. It is very very fast, I had no lag or issues when switching between apps what so ever. The wireless range was very good, with no signal drop anywhere in my house, almost 2,000 sqft. I am using a Linksys WRT54G, one of the older ones, had it for years. The stock browser, utilizes tabbed browsing, and didn&apos;t crash once in the few hours I had used it and was very fast to load pages with a 6 Meg DSL line. With full brightness on and mild surfing and movie watching, I experienced approximately 5 hours of use, to take the battery down to 26%, from a full charge. It is very well constructed in my opinion, it is heavier than IPad 2, but I didn&apos;t find this to be an issue what so ever. I als ...

     <Review>Pros: well made fast

Cons: none

Now this is how fast a tablet should be. Purchased today on vacation at a bestbuy in Carson city NV. Very helpful staff and knowlegable. Very similar to Android 2.1 but Honeycomb is diffrent. Looks like acer partnered with Nvidia, graphics are great and very smooth games and video play back. wish price was 399.00 but 16gb internal memory, dual core, and Nvidia graphics I say this is a 5 star buy at 449.00.</Review>

     <Review>Pros: USB, Mini USB, SD Car, and Mini HDMI

Bought this for my wife as an early Mothers Day present. I was waiting for the Asus Transformer but I&apos;m glad it sold out and i didnt get it for her especially after finding out the only USB it has is on the extra keyboard which is priced at another $150 on top of the $400 price of the tablet. The A500 has a very nice look to it with the brushed aluminum back. The performance on it is outstanding and the screen is very crisp and clear also. The A500 also has everyting you could possibly need on the tablet ( USB, Mini USB, SD Car, and Mini HDMI). For $450 the tablet is well worth it and I believe it will be an Ipad2 killer for sure.</Review>

     <Review>Pros: Speed, value, battery life

Cons: Softtware

Had my mind set on the xoom until I came across this tablet. I am glad I waited. This has the exact same specs as the xoom and actually seemed zippier side by side, not to mention $150 cheaper.

Aside from the awesome hardware I would say Android 3.0 has a little bit of work to do. Overall I&apos;m very happy with the purchase. I highly recommend this device if you&apos;re looking for a 10 inch tablet with great specs at a reasonable price.</Review>

     <Review>Pros: Great features at the right price! Love the LOOKS!!!

Cons: None.. maybe the weight.. but overall pretty good.

I own the Glaxy ( samsung) seven tablet and what a difference! I have to say HoneyComb is awesome! I love it already ( just got it this evening)

Acer did the right thing to price it below ipad! Love the metalic look... and all the ports! I have Acer&apos;s AspireONE and it has been a great buy as well... they did a good job in packing all the great features and pricing it below ipad;

I happen to see the Asus Transformer and it looks cheap and the whole keyboard thing is awkward ..... not to mention all the ports is on the keyboard and NOT on the tablet;

I hope Acer comes up with the 4G option soon! I can hand this one to my wife!

Get one y ... ou will LOVE IT.

BTW, Best Buy said they will have the Acer case soon, don&apos;t forget to get a case.. or you might damage the screen!

     <Review>Pros: Huge screen, fast, cures cancer.

Cons: Battery life a little lacking and no USB charge port.

It has a great price. It&apos;s very fast. It&apos;s storage can be expanded with a USB thumbstick. One of the only problems I&apos;ve had is that it&apos;s too new and there is a lack of peripherals to go with this device. I very-much want a dock/keyboard.

My only true gripe is the lack of USB charging ability. You are required to use the AC/DC charge port. If the battery life were longer. I wouldn&apos;t have a problem with this but I would like to charge the battery off my laptop at work and read a book off it during my commute. So far, the device runs out of juice with very little use during the day.</Review>

     <Review>Pros: Build Quality, Full Size USB port and Price

Cons: Slightly heavier than most tablets

It surprises me that Acer has made the best Android tablet to date. The full size USB port and its build quality of aluminum metallic makes it a better choice than the Transformer. The Asus does not have a full size USB port and is made of cheap plastic instead of the aluminum metallic like the Acer is. This is why the Acer is heavier.</Review>

     <Review>Pros: Customization, powerful hardware, front-and-back cameras, price and value.

Cons: 160 viewing angle, battery life (8 hours)

Nvidia Tegra 2 is going to become the standard cpu to power all tablets for some time to come. 1 GB RAM is currently the highest amount in any tablet as well. In terms of hardware, Iconia does everything that Xoom does, with arguably better software (SD and Flash support out of the box). Honeycomb, or Android 3.0, was designed specifically with tablets in mind. Without ranting off of every single spec users may see on Best Buy&apos;s webpage above, here are a couple of questions that are not addressed yet.

1. True multi-touch. There are some tablets with similar specs (e.g. eLocity A7) out there with capacitive screens that claim to be &quot;multi-touc ... h&quot; when in fact they only support &quot;1+1 touch&quot;, which is used for pinching and zooming only. 1+1 touch has very little practical uses as far as gaming and other more advanced apps are concerned. Acer Iconia has true multi-touch.

2. Access to Android Market. Some tablets with similar specs (e.g. Viewsonic g Tablet) do not come with ready access to Android Market. Unfortunately this is more of a problem with the Android platform overall. But this is one of the trade-offs you get choosing between iOS (iPad) and Android-based tabs: uniform controlled experience versus customization.

3. Regular LCD screen. Capacitive screens for the most part fall in to two camps. One camp uses IPS (in-plane switching) LCD (e.g. iPad 2 and Asus Eee Pad Transformer), which gives greater viewing angles (~178 degrees) and more vibrant pictures. The other uses just regular LCD for about 160 degrees viewing angle. Acer Iconia uses the latter rather than the IPS LCD. Chalk this one up as a minor con.

4. Lastly, no word yet on whether or not it is possible to root Acer Iconia so that if you aren&apos;t happy with the firmware, you might very well be stuck with it and are at the manufacturer&apos;s mercy.

And for those who are confused by the A500&apos;s twin, W500, the ONLY difference is that A500 uses Android, and W500 uses Windows 7. So if you would rather have a Wi ...

     <Review>The Acer a500 is an excellent tablet. The enhanced graphics card makes this tablet one of the better ones on the market. Another great feature is the expandable memory slot, making a huge upgrade just a step away.</Review>
